Data and code for "A Meta-framework for Spatiotemporal Quantity Extraction from Text", ACL 2022

## Update 2022-06-07:
Uploaded raw annotation data and formatted data for T5. Also added examples of experiments and evaluations. 

In the near future, we will carefuly check the experiment compatibility. However, one should be able to run a T5 or any seq2seq model with the data provided under `data/for_t5` and produce outputs. `experiment/evaluator.py` shows how to interpret the output sequences.

            "`` We 're still in the thick of a good firefight , '' Andrew Mitchell , a spokesman for the US Forest Service , said .",
            "In addition to its size , the Bobcat Fire also spun off a `` Firenado , '' which was captured on video .",
            "The Bobcat Fire is one of several fires keeping firefighters busy across the West Coast .",
            "Smoke from the fires have spread across the US , and the fires have displaced thousands of people .",
            "Wildfires have killed at least 34 people this year and creates huge zones where the air is practically toxic due to the smoke and ash .",
            "As of Sunday , the Creek Fire in California was at 27 per cent containment .",
            "Over the weekend , 250 US Marines arrived in the state to help tackle the blaze .",
            "They will spend several days training with the US Forest Service before joining the firefighters trying to control the inferno .",
            "In Oregon , six men were arrested for setting fires that contributed to the wildfires throughout the state .",
            "While conspiracy theories on right-wing social media posts claimed that `` Antifa '' or other left-wing sympathisers were the culprits of the fires , the men who were arrested appear to have no political motivation for setting the fires .",
            "Four of the arrested men - who have criminal records that suggest they have struggled with addiction , homelessness and mental illness - allegedly set small fires that were quickly doused .",
            "The other two men began more serious fires , with one man burning down hundreds of acres of forest , while another is accused of causing damage to more than a dozen homes with his blaze ."

            "Climate change is making wildfires bigger , fiercer , and deadlier , fueling a new kind of despair on the West Coast -- and beyond .",
            "Grief has settled over the western US , along with the thick haze of smoke pouring from dozens of massive wildfires up and down California , Oregon , Colorado , and Washington .",
            "It 's grief over the thousands of structures and at least 33 lives lost so far ; grief over another villain conspiring with Covid-19 to lock people indoors ; grief that the orange-hued dystopia of Blade Runner is now a reality in smoky San Francisco ; grief over losing any sense of normalcy , or indeed a clear future .",
            "Enveloping all of those emotions -- packaging them into an overwhelming feeling of doom -- is climate grief , as psychologists call it , the dread that humans have thoroughly corrupted the planet , and that the planet is now exacting its revenge .",
            "Wildfires were around before human-made climate change , but by pulling a variety of strings , it 's made them bigger , fiercer , and ultimately deadlier , creating what fire historian Steve Pyne has dubbed the Pyrocene , an Age of Flames .",
            "By burning fossil fuels , we 've primed the landscape to burn explosively , and by pushing human communities deeper and deeper into what was once wilderness , we 're provided plenty of opportunities for ignition -- and plenty of opportunities for grief as these forces catastrophically combine .",
            "`` So much is out of our control , '' says Adrienne Heinz , a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine , who studies the effects of disasters like wildfires and the Covid-19 pandemic .",
            "`` We lose our sense of personal agency over how we will live -- the decisions are made for us . ''",
            "`` It shifts from grief over what 's happening with our climate -- can we feel safe in our own communities ?",
            "-- to despair , the differentiator being that you do n't feel like tomorrow is going to be any better than today , '' Heinz adds .",
            "`` That 's where it gets really dark . ''",
            "For the people of Northern California , an exhausting parade of massive wildfires have marched across the landscape over the past several autumns , with many people having to evacuate several years in a row .",
            "Last October , the Kincade Fire burned 120 square miles .",
            "The November before , the Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise and killed 86 people .",
            "And in October 2017 , the Tubbs Fire obliterated 5,600 structures and killed 22 .",
            "The world is getting warmer , the weather is getting worse .",
            "Here 's everything you need to know about what humans can do to stop wrecking the planet .",
            "`` The catchphrase -- kind of with a bitterness around here -- is , ` This is the new normal , ''' says Barbara Young , a licensed marriage and family therapist in Healdsburg , north of San Francisco , who had to evacuate last month .",
            "`` And so with that , I think it 's implied that this is n't going away -- our climate is changing .",
            "These are n't flukes , this is the trend .",
            "And I think everyone is very clear that this is not a one-off .",
            "This is every year now . ''",
            "Year after year of such stress is taking a toll on Americans in the West , Young says .",
            "Even if someone is n't forced to evacuate , the mere whiff of wildfire smoke can be an emotional trigger for survivors of previous blazes .",
            "`` It 's a tremendous amount of fatigue , '' she says .",
            "`` Mental fatigue , physical fatigue , emotional fatigue .",
            "And that 's long-term . ''",
            "California 's wildfires are also chewing through iconic destinations , like Big Basin State Park , bringing a sort of anthropomorphized grief as people mourn for a place they 've bonded with .",
            "`` Places just have a lot of emotional significance for us , '' says psychologist Susan Clayton of the College of Wooster , coauthor of an extensive report on climate change and mental health .",
            "`` And when they 're gone , in some cases people have even talked about it being like losing a family member -- for example , a favorite tree that you 've known for a long time is destroyed . ''",
            "To be sure , wildfires are a perfectly natural and indeed beneficial component of the Western landscape , periodically clearing out an environment and resetting it for new plant growth , which feeds herbivores , which ultimately feed carnivores .",
            "But these recent fires in the American West are far from perfectly normal .",
            "Sparked by a freak thunderstorm system and fueled by record heat and brutal winds , California 's fires over the past month have grown into conflagrations of astounding size and intensity .",
            "About halfway between the Bay Area and the Oregon border , the August Complex -- a `` complex '' is a grouping of blazes -- has ballooned into California 's biggest wildfire on record , at 877,000 acres , or 1,370 square miles .",
            "That nearly doubles the previous record set just two years ago by the Mendocino Complex , which burned 459,000 acres .",
            "Two other complexes currently burning , the SCU Lightning Complex and LNU Lightning Complex , are now the state 's third - and fourth-biggest fires ever , respectively .",
            "Across the state , over 3.2 million acres have burned .",
            "`` The hots are getting hotter , the dries are getting drier , '' said California governor Gavin Newsom in his Democratic National Convention speech on August 20 , recorded a mile from one of hundreds of wildfires burning in the state .",
            "`` Climate change is real .",
            "If you are in denial about climate change , come to California . ''",
            "In Oregon , a plague of wildfires has blackened a million acres and forced tens of thousands to evacuate .",
            "Ten people are dead , and dozens more are missing .",
            "`` We have never seen this amount of uncontained fire across the state , '' Oregon governor Kate Brown said last week .",
            "In Washington , wildfires have burned 600,000 acres .",
            "Still more fires across Colorado have burned hundreds of thousands of acres -- crews got a better handle on these last week when extreme heat suddenly gave way to snow .",
            "Climate change is but one of several co-conspirators in the West 's fiery reckoning .",
            "Part of the problem is that the region has long embraced a policy of squelching fires quickly , so underbrush builds up as fuel year after year .",
            "Part of that problem is that fire crews have ever more people to protect , as the West 's population expands and we build farther into forests .",
            "More people also means more opportunities for accidentally sparking fires .",
            "Plus , bigger populations make it harder for fire crews to do controlled burns -- small , manageable blazes set in the spring when the landscape is hydrated , so there 's less fuel load to burn in the dryness of summer and fall .",
            "But to burn safely , crews have to ensure there are n't people downwind , especially with the continued spread of Covid-19 , a disease that attacks the lungs .",
            "The patterns of how fires burn in a given area , known as wildfire regimes , are changing as human populations expand and the climate grows hotter and drier .",
            "`` The populations within these wildfire regimes are increasing so rapidly that forest management becomes almost impossible , '' says climate scientist Zachary Zobel , who studies wildfires at the Woodwell Climate Research Center .",
            "`` Controlled burns get very challenging when there are population centers around where you 're trying to cleanse the forest , because one misstep and it burns down the entire neighborhood .",
            "I mean , that 's a little bit bleak -- that 's the truth . ''",
            "Plus , things have been so generally hot and dry that crews have less of a window during the spring to even think about doing burns .",
            "Overarching all of these problems is climate change .",
            "Swaths of the western US literally being on fire may seem like an obvious symptom of a world figuratively being on fire , but there are some surprising dynamics at play .",
            "Yes , the West has been extremely dry in recent years , which desiccates mountains of vegetation into mountains of tinder .",
            "And yes , on a hotter planet , the atmosphere sucks what little moisture is left out of those plants more greedily .",
            "The West has gotten so dry and hot , in fact , that areas usually too wet to burn , like northwest Oregon , are right now consumed by flames .",
            "But the collision of climate change and the West 's wildfires is also a matter of timing , and oddly enough , it 's about the abundance of water during a certain time of year .",
            "Having so many intense fires arrive in the summer is odd , actually .",
            "California 's biggest blazes tend to break out in the autumn , when seasonal winds tear in from the northeast .",
            "In decades past , these winds were n't so dangerous , because by the time they arrived , California at least had experienced a little rain , which greened up the vegetation .",
            "But climate change is pushing those rains later and later in the year , giving the parched landscape more time to combust .",
            "And it is n't done pushing yet .",
            "`` Just the raw length of the wildfire season , what we 're expecting over the next couple decades is for that to very much be extending later into the year , '' says Zobel .",
            "And because of climate change , the landscape is drier for longer and wildfires burn more intensely .",
            "But here 's a great irony of climate change : Parts of California are getting very heavy rains during the winter , because the warmer air on a warmer planet holds more moisture .",
            "Come spring , the hydrated landscape explodes with new vegetation , which then shrivels during ever hotter summers .",
            "In other words , the wet winters are leaving the landscape with fuel to burn in the autumn when speedy seasonal winds arrive .",
            "Instead of burning naturally and less intensely every so often , parts of the western US are now in a regular cycle of blooming , getting obliterated by massive wildfires , and blooming once more .",
            "`` If we were just dry all the time , at some point , we would run out of things to burn , essentially , '' says Zobel .",
            "`` The inverse of that is actually probably worse . ''",
            "What makes the resulting grief so painful for the people who live in the West are the dueling certainties and uncertainties of wildfires : Residents know how climate change has exacerbated these fires , and know that the Western landscape will grow more dangerous from now on , but they do n't know where the next Camp Fire or Tubbs Fire will break out , or when whole towns and dozens of lives may be lost in a matter of hours .",
            "We can characterize this hellish new reality , but we ca n't predict the firestorms .",
            "The certainty of climate grief interfaces with the uncertainty of climate anxieties .",
            "`` I think that 's one of the things that characterizes this response to climate change , '' says Clayton of the College of Wooster .",
            "`` For those of us who are absolutely sure that it 's happening , that it 's going to be bad , you still do n't know exactly what impacts might be felt in a particular area and when they 'll happen .",
            "And I think with wildfire , that 's just especially true .",
            "It can be so random .",
            "Such small things can have an impact on where it starts and how much it spreads . ''",
            "As with climate-fueled disasters in general , the West 's wildfire crisis is hitting the least fortunate the hardest .",
            "Researchers from several California universities reported last month on how they used smartphone location data to show that poor Americans have had to travel more than the working-from-home wealthy during the pandemic , likely to get to their essential jobs , putting them more at risk of contracting Covid-19 .",
            "Similarly , while many of the rich are able to huddle safely at home behind double-paned windows with air purifiers humming , essential workers labor outdoors in the West 's choking wildfire smoke , braving a virus that attacks the lungs .",
            "`` We see pictures of farm workers who are working in really horrible air quality that 's bad for their health , '' says Elizabeth Sawin , codirector of Climate Interactive , a nonprofit that focuses on the intersection of climate change and inequity .",
            "Indoors , too , the poor are at greater risk : To keep its equipment from sparking fires when winds kick up , the California utility PG&E has been preemptively cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people .",
            "And while power cuts affect everybody in a region , the wealthy are more likely to have resources like solar panels , or to be able to recover from losses .",
            "`` We could go down the list of people who are likely to lose their power , and with it all the food in their freezer , when replacing the food in their freezer is an economic hardship , '' says Sawin .",
            "The rich can also afford to stay one step ahead of climate change , moving away from rising seas and fire-prone landscapes .",
            "`` We 're starting to hear around the country and around the world , the term climate gentrification , '' says Sawin , `` which is the idea that the places that are safest will soon become unaffordable except to the elite .",
            "So whether that 's high ground in a place that 's prone to flooding or fire-safe areas in the West , I think it 's the same underlying dynamic . ''",
            "This is particularly acute in California , as low-income residents flee expensive coastal cities and settle in less expensive towns near the mountains .",
            "They 've been displaced not by disaster , but toward disaster .",
            "Thus inequities , wildfires , and climate change collide .",
            "Each massive problem on its own is difficult for the human mind to parse , much less all three together .",
            "`` I am doing a lot of work with people on really increasing psychological self-care , spiritual self-care , physical self-care , and to help that fatigue , '' says Young , the therapist in Healdsburg .",
            "`` And I do think that is connected with climate grief .",
            "Finally , maybe we are forced to see how interconnected everything is . ''",

            "As the death toll from the wildfires that have charred millions of acres and created apocalyptic scenes across the West continues to climb , forecasters say that a pattern change is imminent -- but it might not be good news for all .",
            "Over 4.6 million acres of land are actively burning across the West , with most of these blazes ongoing in California , Washington and Oregon , according to the National Interagency Fire Center .",
            "Many of these blazes exploded in size during a high wind event around the Labor Day holiday .",
            "At least 35 people have been killed along the West coast as a result of the blazes , and tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate , according to The Associated Press .",
            "The amount of smoke being emitted by the blazes has led to extremely unhealthy air quality from Seattle to San Francisco and points inland .",
            "High temperatures were about 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in this corridor over the weekend as the thick smoke obscured the sun .",
            "Experts say that Mother Nature will provide some hope for northern areas this week , but not so much for southern areas .",
            "`` Across the Pacific Northwest , there is some hope for rain this week .",
            "This rain is hopefully a sign of things to come as we head toward the climatological end of the fire season across much of the Northwest , '' AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist and western U.S. blogger Brian Thompson said .",
            "The first bout of wet weather will arrive late Monday and persist along coastal areas into Wednesday as a storm system swirls just offshore .",
            "While only spotty showers are anticipated , the increased humidity levels will limit the threat of new blazes igniting and should help fire crews gain the upper hand on active fires .",
            "Winds from the Pacific Ocean will also help to disperse smoke away from the coast , but this could lead to worsening air quality farther inland across the Northwest into midweek .",
            "Even if the smoke disperses for a time during the day , at night when a temperature inversion sets up , smoke can once again become trapped near the ground .",
            "A temperature inversion means that the air is warming up with altitude , as opposed to cooling down .",
            "To the south of the storm system , AccuWeather meteorologists are concerned that gusty winds may increase with no rainfall across Northern California and into the Great Basin , leading to an increased fire danger .",
            "Even farther south where winds may not be as gusty , some of the larger fires can create their own locally strong winds due to the amount of heat generated by these infernos .",
            "The storm system is forecast to slowly move onshore late in the week , bringing more widespread showers with it , possibly as far south as Northern California .",
            "`` Nearly an inch of rain is possible across portions of the Northwest , which would be tremendous news , '' Thompson said .",
            "`` Spotty thunderstorms can not be ruled out with this system , so you may have a situation where lightning may spark new fires - something we 'll have to keep a close eye on , '' Thompson said , adding that he was confident that the positives would outweigh the negatives with this storm in the Northwest .",
            "However , it may be a different story farther south and west .",
            "`` The bad news with this storm is that it will promote gusty winds right as it moves ashore on Thursday across the interior Pacific Northwest , with gusts up to 30 mph , which could help fuel the fires in the area prior to any beneficial rain , '' AccuWeather Meteorologist Tyler Roys said .",
            "Gusty winds will also significantly increase the fire danger over the Great Basin and central Rockies late in the week , with no rainfall expected from the storm in these areas .",
            "Smoke is likely to be more widely dispersed out of California during this time frame .",
            "`` In areas where there is smoke , daily afternoon temperatures will continue to be suppressed , '' Roys said .",
            "Smoke inhalation can make breathing difficult and can cause coughing , runny nose , bronchitis , wheezing and exacerbation of chronic diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , according to Plume Labs , a company that monitors air pollution around the globe .",
            "Officials are warning people to avoid or limit spending time outdoors amid the hazardous smoky conditions .",
            "Residents across the western United States can monitor the air quality levels in their neighborhood with AccuWeather 's Air Quality page , which includes detailed air quality forecasts .",
            "There is a chance the 2020 fire season across the West may approach the record number of acres burned in modern history , 10.1 million in 2015 ."

            "SACRAMENTO , Calif. -- ( AP ) -- With the smell of California wildfires in the air , President Donald Trump on Monday ignored the scientific consensus that climate change is playing a central role in historic West Coast infernos and renewed his unfounded claim that failure to rake forest floors and clear dead timber is mostly to blame .",
            "The fires are threatening to become another front in Trump 's reelection bid , which is already facing hurdles because of the coronavirus pandemic , joblessness and social unrest .",
            "His Democratic challenger , Joe Biden , in his own speech Monday said the destruction and mounting death toll across California , Oregon and Washington require stronger presidential leadership and labeled Trump a `` climate arsonist . ''",
            "Trump , who was briefed during a stop near Sacramento before a campaign visit to Phoenix , had been mostly quiet as the catastrophe on the West Coast has unfolded over the past few weeks .",
            "He tweeted appreciation of firefighters and emergency responders on Friday , the first public comments he had made in weeks about the fires that have killed dozens , burned millions of acres and forced thousands from their homes .",
            "He contended anew that Democratic state leaders are to blame for failing to rake leaves and clear dead timber from forest floors .",
            "Trump offered no evidence to support his claim , and wildfire experts and forest managers say raking leaves makes no sense for vast U.S. wilderness and forests .",
            "And many of the blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands , not forest .",
            "To that end , Biden in his address did not wade into political and policy disagreements among Democrats , progressive activists and even some Republicans who acknowledge the climate crisis .",
            "As he has before , Biden sought to frame his energy proposals as an immediate necessity and a long-term economic boon focusing more on new jobs and a cleaner economy that would offset any initial costs .",
            "Trump visited McClellan Park , a former U.S. Air Force Base about 10 miles outside Sacramento that is used by firefighters as a staging area for large aircraft used in combating blazes .",
            "Most of the largest firefighting aircraft have not been utilized in recent days due to heavy smoke limiting visibility .",
            "In 2015 , Trump stated bluntly : `` I 'm not a believer in global warming , I 'm not a believer in man-made global warming . ''",
            "After the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report concluded climate change would hurt the economy , Trump said he read it but did n't believe it .",
            "In September 2019 , he falsely slammed the Green New Deal as an effort that would lead to `` No more cows .",
            "No more planes ... no more people , right ? ''",
            "All five of the state 's largest fires in history have raged in the past three years , including the deadliest fire , a 2018 blaze that killed 85 people when it swept through the town of Paradise on the slopes of the Sierra Nevada .",

            "San Jose Mercury News ( CA ) Sep. 14 -- California 's plight took center stage Monday in the race for the White House as President Donald Trump visited the the Golden State in the midst of an epic wildfire season that has ravaged Western states , blaming `` forest management '' while his Democratic rival called him a `` climate arsonist . ''",
            "Joe Biden , the Democratic nominee and former vice president , said Monday from his home state of Delaware that Trump is a `` climate arsonist '' whose refusal to accept and address climate change is making fires and other disasters worse .",
            "`` If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze ? ''",
            "Biden said , as Sen. Kamala Harris , his vice presidential running mate , headed to California .",
            "Protesters and supporters gathered in Sacramento where Trump arrived at 10:40 a.m. to meet with California fire officials at McClellan Park , a former Air Force base that closed in 2003 .",
            "After touching down , Trump told reporters before a ceremony recognizing the California National Guard that `` it 's a great honor to be here '' and that `` we want to pay our respects '' to those who lost their lives in the recent wildfires .",
            "Regarding the wildfires , Trump said `` I think this is more of a management situation '' that requires more cutting to thin fire fuel -- `` you see it in Europe . ''",
            "The president said `` we 've been working well with Gavin '' Newsom , California 's governor , to address issues and added that he acted quickly to declare an emergency and speed federal aid , but dodged questions whether climate change is affecting the state .",
            "`` You 'll have to ask the governor that question , '' Trump said .",
            "`` I do n't want to step on his toes . ''",
            "Newsom joined state fire and emergency officials in Monday 's wildfire briefing with the president .",
            "Following the private briefing , the governor was headed to Butte County , one of the active fire areas in the state .",
            "The fires have injected disaster management and climate change into the burning hot 2020 presidential race that is at its peak but mostly being fought in battleground states back east , with the West Coast expected to vote solidly Democratic .",
            "`` In the presidential campaign , California wildfires can become a prop for both candidates , '' said Dan Schnur , a political scientist at the University of Southern California .",
            "`` Both Donald Trump and Joe Biden would like to see the problem addressed , but also recognize political opportunities that the fires present for them .",
            "`` Trump gets to play the role of concerned commander in chief today and then he can go back to other parts of the country to ridicule California to his most loyal supporters , '' Schnur continued .",
            "`` Biden gets the chance to reinforce his climate-change credentials to swing voters and also to paint Trump as uncaring and out of touch .",
            "Neither one of them is seriously competing for votes from California , but both could reap the benefits elsewhere . ''",
            "Western wildfires that erupted last month from lightning strikes have grabbed national headlines as they set records for acres burned in California and also burned across Oregon and Washington .",
            "The fires have burned more than 3.1 million acres in California and filled the air with smoke so thick it dimmed the skies to an eerie orange last week .",
            "The president on Friday thanked firefighters on social media Friday and announced disaster aid for states .",
            "The Biden-Harris campaign said Harris will return to California on Monday and meet Tuesday with emergency service personnel for an assessment of the state 's wildfires before heading to Las Vegas .",
            "Harris mentioned the fires on social media over the weekend , suggesting the federal government has n't done enough to help wildfire victims .",
            "California 's 2018 fire season had set a record with nearly 2 million acres burned in wildfires that included the 153,336-acre Camp Fire that incinerated the town of Paradise .",
            "Sparked by faulty electrical equipment during a November wind storm , it killed 85 and become the deadliest and most destructive in state history .",
            "Last year 's fire season was milder , with 259,863 acres burned and the most significant blaze the 77,758-acre Kincade Fire also ignited by utility equipment in a wind storm .",
            "But most of the state 's worst fire seasons have come in the last five years .",
            "The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said five of the state 's largest fires on record have burned this year , and blamed `` extreme weather conditions . ''",
            "Newsom said 24 people have died and 44,000 people have been evacuated because of the fires .",
            "Newsom has generally avoided criticizing Trump directly , but last week pointedly criticized `` climate deniers '' who dismiss the role that burning coal , oil and gas for heating , power and transportation plays in warming the planet -- something the state has been trying to fix by aggressively pursuing renewable solar and wind energy , though its policies drew some criticism last month after power shortages and rolling blackouts .",
            "Last month , California officials signed a major agreement with the federal government that aims to reshape how forests are managed .",
            "Under the plan , California agencies and the U.S. Forest Service will use brush clearing , logging and prescribed fires to thin out 1 million acres a year by 2025 , and roughly double the current rate of thinning , which already is double rates from a few years ago .",
            "The Forest Service and the state Natural Resources Agency also committed to drawing up a 20-year plan by next year to identify which areas of the state will get priority for thinning projects .",
            "Jessica Morse , deputy secretary for forest resource management at the California Natural Resources Agency , said last month that `` the legacy of fire suppression has contributed to the overstocked forests that we have today , '' and that `` it 's leading to catastrophic wildfires that are compounded by climate change . ''",
            "During Monday 's meeting between Trump and Newsom , the president said he will award the Flying Cross to seven first responders the governor had recommended for rescuing people trapped by the fires , according to a press pool report from the Sacramento Bee .",
            "Newsom said `` it 's great to have you back here in the state , '' and thanked Trump for helping California during the fires , saying federal support received may be a record .",
            "Regarding the factors fueling the blazes , Newsom said `` there 's no question ... that we have not done justice on our forest management , '' but added `` that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this . ''",
            "Trump expressed doubts -- `` I do n't think the science knows , '' but Newsom urged him to `` please respect the difference of opinion out here when it comes to climate change . ''",
            "`` Absolutely , '' Trump replied .",
            "The Sacramento Bee contributed to this report .",

            "( AP ) -- Two big mountain wildfires in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming were growing again Thursday after burning dozens of cabins and other structures .",
            "A forecast calling for at least several more days of dry , breezy weather offered little help in the fight against the Cameron Peak Fire 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) west of Fort Collins , Colorado , or the Mullen Fire 100 miles ( 160 kilometers ) west of Cheyenne , Wyoming .",
            "Higher humidity , however , bought firefighters time before the fires ' usual afternoon flare-ups .",
            "They intentionally burned debris in some places to deprive the fires of fuel while helicopters dumped water on some of the hottest areas .",
            "Containment of the Cameron Peak Fire increased to 30 % while containment of the Mullen Fire was just beginning .",
            "They are two of the Rocky Mountain region 's biggest fires in recent years .",
            "Each was burning through rugged pine forest dotted with communities of cabins , many of which are n't inhabited year-round , Both were approaching 200 square miles ( 320 square kilometers ) in size .",
            "The Cameron Peak Fire became the third-largest in Colorado history since starting Aug. 13 and was the priority of firefighters in the state , Gov.",
            "Jared Polis said .",
            "Ninety-five structures , including about two dozen homes , had burned in the fire spreading through the upper Cache la Poudre River drainage , deep within the Front Range .",
            "About 960 people were involved in firefighting efforts , the Coloradoan reported .",
            "Polis met Wednesday with firefighters and others at a command center in Fort Collins as the fire came within 2 miles ( 3 kilometers ) of the cabin communities of Crystal Lakes and Red Feather Lakes , which had been evacuated .",
            "The largest fire in Colorado history , near Grand Junction , burned about 215 square miles ( 560 square kilometers ) and was contained on Sept. 15 .",
            "About 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) northwest of the Cameron Peak Fire , the Mullen Fire spread into northern Colorado after burning across Wyoming 's Medicine Bow National Forest , a distance of over 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) .",
            "The fire 's intensity made it difficult for sheriff 's officials to maintain a current tally of damage , but it had destroyed at least 29 homes and 31 other structures in Wyoming since starting in the Savage Run Wilderness on Sept. 17 .",
            "The fire had burned across most of Savage Run and on Wednesday ran up the North Platte River drainage to finish burning the entirety of the Platte River Wilderness .",
            "The 37-square-mile ( 95-square-kilometer ) wilderness is a prime trout fishing destination .",
            "The fire closed two state highways north of Walden , Colorado .",
            "Mandatory evacuation orders were in place for the Wyoming cabin communities of Albany and Woods Landing .",
            "About 900 people were involved in fighting the fire while helicopters and airplanes scooped water from lakes and a reservoir to dump on the flames .",
            "The biggest Wyoming community potentially at risk was Centennial , population 270 , where officials urged residents to be ready to evacuate should the fire spread eastward onto the open , sagebrush-covered Laramie River Basin .",
            "Forecasters were somewhat optimistic that another spell of higher humidity with the arrival of a front Friday could help slow the fires ' afternoon flare-ups .",
            "The forecast also called for windy weather , however , through at least Monday .",
            "Both fires were sending at times thick clouds of smoke onto the western Great Plains .",
            "The National Weather Service posted air quality alerts for the mountains and an area from Cheyenne to south of Denver .",
            "Elsewhere in the region , crews were battling a fire near Fraser , Colorado , that had burned 20 square miles ( 51 square kilometers ) and a fire near the Steamboat Springs ski resort community that has burned 12 square miles ( 31 square kilometers ) .",

            "The incendiary weather , supercharging fuel beds overgrown with tinder-dry grass and scrub , is expected to challenge firefighters through the weekend as they battle to defend Napa Valley 's homes and wineries in the midst of its harvest season .",
            "`` It 's going to be a big firefight for us in the next 36 hours , '' Cal Fire operations section chief Mark Brunton told a late-morning briefing .",
            "He added commanders were forced to make due with `` a limited amount of resources '' due to competing demands for fire personnel throughout the state .",
            "As of Thursday , firefighters have managed to carve firm containment lines around just 5 % of the Glass Fire perimeter , which has grown to encompass nearly 57,000 acres ( 23,000 hectares ) .",
            "HEADWAY MADE IN CASCADES By contrast , Cal Fire reported making significant headway against a slightly smaller blaze , the Zogg Fire about 200 miles to the north in the foothills of the Cascade range , with containment increasing there to 26 % , up from 9 % a day earlier .",
            "The Zogg fire , which has destroyed nearly 150 buildings near the town of Redding , has claimed four lives , raising to 30 the number of people killed since mid-August in what now ranks as the worst California wildfire season on record in terms of acreage incinerated .",
            "The Zogg and Glass fires marked the latest flashpoints in a devastating string of wildfires across the U.S. West this summer , stoked by increasingly frequent , prolonged bouts of extreme heat , winds and dry-lightning storms that scientists attribute to climate change .",
            "No serious injuries or deaths have been reported so far in the Glass Fire , but 52,000 people were under evacuation orders or warnings in Napa and Sonoma counties , Cal Fire said .",
            "Of particular concern , Brunton said , were areas in and around Calistoga , a town of 5,300 residents known for its mineral springs , mud baths and wine tasting rooms but vacated by evacuation orders on Monday .",
            "He said several nearby communities , including Angwin , Pope Valley and Oakville , as well as various wineries and properties along the valley floor , were in harm 's way if resurgent winds continue to spread flames in their direction .",
            "The Glass Fire has already destroyed at least 248 homes and other structures , including the mansion-like Chateau Boswell winery and a farmhouse containing fermentation , bottling and storage facilities at the landmark Castello di Amorosa winery .",
            "That winery 's main castle-like building was itself unscathed .",
            "The Newton Vineyard winery also went up in flames , according to a Reuters photographer who visited the site on Wednesday , observing rivulets of red wine mixed with ash flowing down its main access road .",
            "Wine industry officials say the longer-term consequence of the Glass Fire and a spate of other blazes that came before it is likely to be a 2020 vintage of diminished volume due to grapes spoiled by heavy exposure to smoke .",
            "Chief Brunton said authorities were allowing wine growers in the fire zone to continue with harvest operations , where possible , given `` this time of year being critical for them . ''",
            "A Sonoma County native who began his career in the area three decades ago , Brunton said the region 's wildfire activity as greatly intensified over the past five years , forcing fire professionals `` to adapt to the changing environment . ''",
            "California fires have scorched nearly 6,100 square miles acres ( 15,800 square km ) since January , more than three times the land mass of Delaware and far exceeding the acreage burned during any previous year on record .",
            "Governor Gavin Newsom , saying his family has a stake in four Napa wineries , held in a blind trust , visited the Glass Fire zone on Thursday .",
            "He called the destruction `` heartbreaking . ''",
            "`` We 're very sorry you 're going through all of this , '' he told residents .",

            "`` Regions that have been torn asunder by wildfires seemingly every single year , this drum beat where people are exhausted , concerned , anxious about their fate and their future not just their safety , '' Newsom said , adding with a hint of exhaustion , `` so clearly we have our work cut out for us to deal with not only suppression , but prevention strategies . ''",
            "Top of the prevention strategy list for fire ecologists is more fire .",
            "This historically destructive wildfire season across much of the Western U.S. has wildfire experts calling for a dramatic increase in the numbers of acres intentionally burned .",
            "( That 's when trained staff deliberately set fires as a form of control .",
            ") They also want significant new investment in workforce training and infrastructure to scale up prescribed burns on public and private lands .",
            "Vastly increasing the number of these low-intensity , carefully managed fires is key .",
            "Experts say it reduces dangerous levels of highly combustible fuel and underbrush built up over more than a century of trying to snuff out most every forest fire .",
            "The conditions set by that longstanding federal and state policy are now worsened by climate change , with fires growing larger , more frequent and more destructive .",
            "Support comes from `` Some people might say that they 're scared of doing prescribed fire .",
            "But you know , I 'm scared what will happen in the next 10 years if we do n't get prescribed fire , '' says fire ecologist and professor Kate Wilkin with the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center at San Jose State University .",
            "` Use more fire to fix region 's wildfire problem ' In Colorado , three of the state 's five largest wildfires have burned this year , including the still-burning East Troublesome and Cameron Peak blazes .",
            "In California , five of biggest on record have occurred just since August .",
            "Wilkin recognizes how awful it 's been for many in recent years : people who 've lost loved ones , homes , businesses and entire communities damaged or destroyed .",
            "There 's the fear , stress and the smoke-filled air drifting hundreds of miles .",
            "So she knows most people in the West right now might not want to hear it , but the West needs to strategically use more fire to fix the region 's wildfire problem .",
            "In terms of forest health , Wilkin says , California is supposed to burn .",
            "So when the state topped 4 million acres burned earlier this month , setting a record , Wilkin thought , `` Wow , we 're actually getting into the ballpark of how many acres used to burn in California every year .",
            "Historically , somewhere between 4.4 million and 12 million acres used to burn every year . ''",
            "By contrast , in the past few years California intentionally burned roughly 50 thousand acres on public lands .",
            "In fact , a study published in the journal Fire showed that prescribed burns on federal lands in the West over the past 20 years stayed flat or fell despite ongoing calls to do much more .",
            "` Losing this battle every year ' Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) was the only federal agency to substantially increase prescribed fire use , the study said , likely due to tribal self-governance and a historic embrace of intentional fire .",
            "Federal and California officials recently signed an agreement to try boost that significantly : the new goal is to treat about 1 million acres a year with combined thinning and controlled burns .",
            "But experts warn that states continue to set ambitions prescribed fire goals they never reach .",
            "And critics say that new goal is nowhere near enough to meet this moment .",
            "`` It 's not something in which incremental , cautious decisions are going to solve the problem , '' says Malcolm North , an outspoken research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who has long advocated for more controlled burns .",
            "`` We have some of the best firefighting forces in the in the world .",
            "And yet we 're obviously losing this battle every year , both in terms of cost , acreage and damages . ''",
            "North says the public has to realize that they 're going to get fire one way or another .",
            "`` But you can have much better outcomes when you 're proactively putting the fire on the landscape rather than reactively trying to suppress it and then dealing with the inevitable escapes , '' he says He and others say a major obstacle to expanding controlled burns is institutional inertia in these large , risk-averse state and federal agencies .",
            "Critics say both Cal Fire and the U.S. Forest Service largely continue to embrace an antiquated ` fight every fire ' ethos .",
            "Leaders in federal land management positions , North says , need to be much more supportive and bold in their use of targeted use of prescribed fire .",
            "There needs to be a cultural shift in the public 's understanding about both the inevitability of fire , he says , and a shift within the leadership of these agencies .",
            "`` The people who end up getting promoted and often end up in the leadership positions are very good at being cautious , '' North says of his own employer the U.S. Forest Service .",
            "`` You really need a pretty fundamental and aggressive change to what we 're doing .",
            "And that 's not inherently the behavior that you often get in leadership in these in these positions . ''",
            "Still , North recognizes the enormous challenge for managers : it 's not popular or easy to intentionally light fires to clear out built-up fuel when states are being ravaged and citizens reeling from annual catastrophic wildfires .",
            "If historically flawed forest management is half the problem here -- battling most every fire - the other half is the world 's warming climate with hotter , drier conditions igniting a Century of built-up fuel .",
            "`` It 's a great example of climate change as a kind of an accelerant , '' says Michael Wara with Stanford 's Woods Institute for the Environment .",
            "`` This is a problem that 's been building gradually for decades .",
            "But what is happening this decade is the problem has kind of turned from this thing that we can manage to a monster . ''",
            "` Problem too big for states to solve on their own ' And taming that monster through intentional fire , Wara says , is vital yet costly : It 's estimated that thinning and prescribed burns can cost somewhere between $ 1,500 and $ 2,000 per acre .",
            "The problem is simply too big for states to solve on their own , especially since the federal government owns the vast majority of public lands in the West , not the states .",
            "`` Coming up with the money to do this at scale has always been a major obstacle , '' Wara says .",
            "`` We need sustained federal and state financial support if we 're going to have any hope of moving the needle and bring good fire back into the landscape in a way that will be big enough to actually make a difference . ''",
            "Another challenge too big to solve alone is the lack of a trained workforce to prep and conduct more controlled fires .",
            "Fire suppression crews remain stretched incredibly thin across much of the West .",
            "And putting out fires and setting controlled blazes `` really are two different skill sets , '' says University of California , Berkeley Fire Science professor Scott Stephens who has long documented the positive impact of fire on the forest eco-system .",
            "`` So it really does require us to develop that workforce . ''",
            "Stephens and other experts in fire ecology want the region to train up an entirely new force , like the one the southern U.S. already has .",
            "`` There are so many people in the South that are certified prescribed fire burn bosses and practitioners , and they do n't work in fire suppression at all , '' he says adding , `` we just do n't have that out here . ''",
            "Despite the long , bitter fights in Washington , D.C. , over how to manage the nation 's forests there are currently several bills in the U.S. Senate that would significantly boost federal funding for intentional fires .",
            "One of them even has a little bipartisan support .",
            "And two of the bills call for the creation of a Western U.S. prescribed fire training center to build that much-needed workforce to learn to prep and set fires , not just put them out .",
            "Other big barriers to doing more intentional burns include tough environmental rules and strong liability laws that can slow the pace and scale of set blazes .",
            "For example , some intentional burns have taken years to plan and implement .",
            "Then there 's safety .",
            "The vast majority of these fires are done without harm to people or property .",
            "But not all .",
            "A 2012 prescribed fire in Colorado killed three people and damaged or destroyed more than two dozen homes .",
            "Another example is a notorious U.S. National Park Service controlled burn 20 years ago near Los Alamos , New Mexico got out of control when high winds picked up .",
            "Some 400 family homes were burned .",
            "The federal nuclear lab there was threatened , with a few of its buildings damaged .",
            "Withering criticism and congressional hearings followed .",
            "`` The plan was flawed , the higher ups rubber stamped it , the burn boss was not qualified to do a fire this big , '' then-Congresswoman Heather Wilson , a Republican , told a house hearing on the burn shortly after the fire .",
            "That Los Alamos fire kind of became the Enron or Solyndra of controlled burns : a rare but spectacularly botched event that ends up having out-sized influence and ripple effects .",
            "Twenty years on , the Los Alamos debacle is still felt today across federal land agencies .",
            "It 's a ghost that needs to be exorcised , ecologists say , because controlled burns are largely safe .",
            "`` The perception there is definitely far different than the reality , which is that the fires generally have been able to be controlled , '' says the Forest Service 's Malcolm North .",
            "For fire-ravaged communities the hard truth is that these shifts to increase controlled blazes and reduce catastrophic fire risk will take years , if not decades , of sustained effort .",
            "`` So that 's the real problem because , you know , it is n't something that you can invest in wholeheartedly , say , in three years and guarantee yourself a result , '' says UC Berkeley 's Stephens .",
            "`` It would take a 10-year effort , but probably even closer to 20 to really start to change kind of the fundamentals '' of wildfire risk ."

            "The fire was blamed for the deaths of three firefighters , fourth injuries and the destruction of 90 single-family dwellings , 86 cabins and nearly 100 outbuildings .",
            "- The Wallow Fire started in the White Mountains of east-central Arizona on May 29 , 2011 and soon became the state 's largest wildfire , consuming 538,049 acres ( 217,740 hectares ) as it spread into western New Mexico .",

            "We can also slow the spread of fire by increasing the size of firebreaks and gaps in vegetation between forests and homes so our communities are protected .",
            "Our bill facilitates the use of those firebreaks and helps homeowners retrofit with fire-resistant materials to lessen the chances of whole neighborhoods being destroyed by an approaching fire , as we saw in Paradise .",
            "Additionally , by increasing the use of controlled burns , we could remove undergrowth to make our forests more resilient to catastrophic fires .",
            "Prescribed burns recreate the natural phenomenon of undergrowth removal that occurred for millennia , preventing forests from becoming overgrown and more susceptible to unstoppable fires .",
            "Our bill creates a training center for firefighters on best practices for controlled burns so they can implement them in our forests .",
            "By limiting the size and spread of future fires , prescribed burns not only keep our communities safer , but they also prevent ancient old-growth trees like our precious redwoods from burning as well .",

            "So far , governors in Arizona , Nevada and Texas have agreed to send crews and support , Newsom said , though he did n't offer specifics .",
            "Newsom said the state had also recently added 830 more seasonal firefighters to an agency that averages 6,000 full-time professionals .",
            "Yet those additions came as CalFire continues to lose what once constituted a large force within its ranks -- prison inmates .",
            "In 2015 , the state relied on roughly 3,800 minimum-security inmates to help fight wildfires .",
            "As of Thursday , that number had shrunk to 1,659 , a spokesman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said .",
            "The reduction was partly driven by longstanding efforts to reduce overcrowding in California 's prison system , but it 's been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic , when the state began releasing thousands of mostly nonviolent prisoners early .",
            "`` Those lower-risk inmates are no longer sitting in jail , '' Edwards said .",

            "Still , he added , `` That 's 30 firefighters that normally would be home and off duty who are back in the seats of fire engines . ''",
            "The San Jose Fire Department has dispatched between 40 and 50 firefighters to help , a department spokesman said , while the San Francisco Fire Department has sent 60 personnel and 13 engines to three fires , according to spokesman Lt. Jonathan Baxter .",
            "Baxter said San Francisco is unusual because it has a team of dedicated mutual aid personnel -- roughly 400 of the department 's 1,600 firefighters have volunteered to train and fight wildland fires .",
            "When help is requested , he said , those firefighters can be dispatched in about an hour .",
            "`` What 's different about what we 're seeing now is the immediate need for mutual aid , '' he said .",
            "`` Someone will call up and say , ` We need help and we need it right now . '",

            "This was the case Wednesday when two teams were sent to the LNU Lightning Complex Fire northeast of the city , he said .",
            "Edwards , meanwhile , worried about the toll all those lengthy shifts during the most extreme conditions will take on firefighters .",
            "`` They 're going to do the job , do n't get me wrong .",
            "They 're going to do the best job they can , '' he said .",

            "Nov. 19 -- Three months after the biggest wildfire in more than 100 years roared through Big Basin Redwoods State Park in the Santa Cruz Mountains , new drone video is showing the extent of the damage -- but also the rebirth , which amazingly already has begun .",
            "Shot Nov. 10 , the footage depicts scenes from high above the massive redwoods that could appear devastating to the untrained eye .",
            "Vast swaths of redwood forest in California 's first state park , a beloved landmark where some redwoods tower more than 300 feet and date back nearly 2,000 years , are brown , their leaves scorched by the heat of the flames in the CZU Lightning Complex Fire on Aug. 19 and 20 .",
            "Other parts of the landscape are still green .",
            "Some are burned black , like a World War I battlefield .",
            "`` There are sections that burned hot where you will have patches of 100 % mortality , '' said Jim Campbell-Spickler , a forest canopy biologist at Humboldt State University who shot the footage for Save the Redwoods League in San Francisco .",
            "`` But most of redwoods survived .",
            "Even three months after we are already seeing sprouts on some of the trees . ''",
            "The close-up footage of the famed Mother of the Forest and Father of the Forest trees , located near the park headquarters where nearly 1 million visitors a year pass through , shows some damage .",
            "Both ancient trees are charred along their bark .",
            "Part of the top of the Mother of the Forest , which was 293 feet tall , broke off .",
            "The Father of the Forest , which is 250 feet tall , shows damage where flames clearly reached the top of its massive height .",
            "But both trees will live on , Campbell-Spickler said .",
            "Not only do redwoods have bark which is a foot thick and fire resistant , they have evolved for millennia with fire .",
            "As long as at least 10 % of their inner layer , called the cambium , is unburned , they nearly always regrow after fires , he said .",
            "Save the Redwoods League plans to return to the same locations and shoot drone footage for years into the future to document the recovery of the park .",
            "Big Basin will remain closed to the public for at least a year , state parks officials say .",
            "The fire , the biggest blaze in Big Basin since 1904 , destroyed the historic headquarters , nature center , campgrounds , bridges , restrooms and other facilities .",
            "Rangers and other parks officials have been hiking every mile of trail in recent weeks , documenting millions of dollars in damage .",
            "Branches and some trees , particularly Douglas firs , which are less fire resistant , are expected to fall for months during windy winter days .",
            "`` We 're looking at hazards , not only immolated infrastructure , '' said Joanne Kerbavaz , a senior environmental scientist with the state parks department .",
            "`` We do n't feel that it 's time to send people into the backcountry . ''",
            "Of Big Basin 's 18,000 acres , roughly 97 % burned , she said .",
            "Large ferns , huckleberries and other plants in the understory of the forest should grow back to a decent size in a year or two , Kerbavaz said .",
            "Chapparal on the drier hilltop areas of the park also will recover quickly .",
            "Green growth is already visible in some charred areas , and rains last week will accelerate it .",
            "`` Everything that can sprout is sprouting , '' she said .",
            "The drone footage clearly shows early green shoots that are beginning to appear on the trunk and branches of the Mother of the Forest and other burned old-growth redwoods .",
            "Neither Kerbavaz or Campell-Spickler said there was anything they saw in the footage that gave them major concern in terms of the redwoods ' recovery .",
            "Kerbavaz noted that after the 1904 fire , people thought the park was destroyed .",
            "The same thing happened at Yellowstone National Park after lightning fires in 1988 charred 793,000 acres .",
            "But she said it will take decades , generations probably , for Big Basin to grow back entirely the way people remember it .",
            "`` These are thousand-year-old trees living on the roots of thousand-year-old trees , '' she said .",
            "`` For us 100 years is a long time .",
            "For the trees , it is n't . ''",
            "Although Big Basin 's landscape is resilient , its buildings are not .",
            "Kerbavaz said state parks officials do not yet have a final damage estimate .",
            "Private organizations have raised more than $ 566,000 for the park 's immediate needs and to help its rangers and staff , many of whose homes burned .",
            "Sempervirens Fund , based in Los Altos , the Mountain Parks Foundation in Felton , and Save the Redwoods League , Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks and other groups continue to raise money .",
            "A large portion of the rebuilding costs are like to come from the federal government through FEMA disaster funds , while the state is also expected to provide millions .",

            "California ( NBC ) ( 12/02/20 ) -- The captain of the California dive boat that caught fire in 2019 , killing 34 people on a weekend trip , has been indicted on seaman 's manslaughter counts , prosecutors said Tuesday .",
            "Thirty-three passengers and one crew member died after the fire erupted on the Conception , a 75-foot diving vessel , early Sept. 2 off the coast of Santa Cruz Island .",
            "The captain , Jerry Nehl Boylan , who was one of five crew members who escaped , was indicted by a grand jury Tuesday on 34 counts of seaman 's manslaughter , the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles said in a statement .",
            "The indictment alleges misconduct and negligence , including the failure to have a night watch or patrol -- something that federal transportation safety officials had also highlighted in October .",
            "The National Transportation Safety Board had also faulted the U.S. Coast Guard for not enforcing the requirement to post a roving night watchman .",
            "The 34 people who died were sleeping below deck when the fire occurred .",
            "They were on a Labor Day weekend dive trip .",
            "Among the dead were five members of one family and two charter school students .",
            "Boylan , age 67 , of Santa Barbara , is expected to self-surrender in the coming weeks , the U.S. attorney 's office said .",
            "In addition to the failure to have a night watch , the indictment also alleges failures in sufficient crew training and fire drills , prosecutors said .",
            "The boat sank , and the exact cause of the fire has not been determined .",
            "NTSB member Jennifer Homendy said in October that regardless of the source of ignition , the focus should be on the conditions present `` that allowed the fire to go undetected and to grow to a point where it prevented the evacuation . ''",
            "Emailed requests to federal public defenders representing Boylan were not immediately returned Tuesday evening .",
            "`` As a result of the alleged failures of Captain Boylan to follow well-established safety rules , a pleasant holiday dive trip turned into a hellish nightmare as passengers and one crew member found themselves trapped in a fiery bunkroom with no means of escape , '' Nick Hanna , U.S. attorney for the central district of California , said in a statement .",
            "The NTSB has blamed the fire on what it said was the failure of Truth Aquatics , Inc. to provide effective oversight , including a roving patrol .",
            "All the deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation .",
            "The federal transportation safety board 's report concludes that most were awake but could not escape before being overcome .",
            "The Coast Guard was called about the fire at around 3:14 a.m. that morning .",
            "The five crewmembers who survived were asleep in an upper deck area , and those who died were in the bunkroom below .",
            "Those crewmembers tried to get help those in the bunkroom but were blocked from reaching it by fire and thick smoke .",
            "There were smoke detectors aboard , but there were none in the main deck salon above the bunkroom , and that 's where crewmembers reported seeing the fire , the NTSB found .",
            "A fire there would have been well involved before the smoke set off the detectors , it said .",
            "Among its recommendations , the NTSB called for smoke detectors in all passenger areas , safer exits in case of fire , and that the Coast Guard create an inspection program to ensure that night patrols are being conducted .",

            "The report noted about half of the state 's 33 million acres of forestland needed restoration to reduce the potential for massive forest fires .",
            "The commission -- an independent state oversight committee that is not beholden to either climate crazies or climate deniers -- issued their report after examining the 2017 fire season .",
            "The 2017 fire season today looks like a piddling dumpster fire compared to the current fire season that has charred 4,267,656 million acres due to 8,320 fires to date while destroying 9,427 buildings ( virtually all homes ) and has killed 31 people .",
            "At the time of the commission report , the 2017 fire season was the worst on record .",
            "There were 9,133 wildfires that burned 1,248,600 acres , killed 44 people and destroyed 9,470 structures .",

            "The number of homes destroyed was more than in the previous nine fire seasons combined .",
            "The 2018 report states `` a century of fire suppression remains firmly entrenched within federal and state firefighting agencies and has left forest floors deep in flammable ground cover . ''",
            "The Little Hoover Commission also pointed out `` plans for prescribed burning to rid the forests of dense ground cover often clash with regional air quality regulations , even as emissions from catastrophic wildfires nullify hard-cough carbon reduction . ''",
            "The commission also noted court fights and such between environmental groups and timber concerns `` hinder policy goals to thin overgrown forests to their original condition . ''",
            "The report drew heavy on fire science and environmental studies that conclude periodic fires not only help to reduce the creation of heavy fuel loads of brush , dead and dying trees , as well as thickets of young trees but also help create a safer and more vibrant ecological system .",
            "Not allowing fires to burn -- which the Forest Service allows to happen with most remote forest fires caused by lightning strikes during normal weather years -- or conducting prescribed burns in areas that have n't burned for years or is near developed areas where fuel growth accumulates setting the stage for massive conflagrations we have been experiencing in recent years .",
            "So what do you think California actually spent on prescribed burns in 2018 , the year after what was then the worst wildfire season on record in state history ?",
            "Sacramento spent $ 30 million from cap-and-trade revenues -- the greenhouse gas tax levied against corporations that is passed onto consumers in the price of goods -- to reduce fire fuel on 60,000 acres .",
            "That , by the way , is 0.4 percent of the 16.5 million acres that were identified as having extensive fuel loads making them ripe to feed massive wildfires .",

            "Even if you contend electric cars are the new reality and embrace Governor Gavin Newsom 's edict to ban the sale of all new vehicles that are gas or diesel powered starting in 2035 , does it make sense to divert cap-and-trade revenue as Sacramento has done to keep the high speed rail money pit to nowhere chugging along towards its $ 100 billion spending mark ?",
            "California 's greenhouse gas reduction program has all the makings of a Keystone Cops production .",
            "Why are we investing $ 100 billion into a high speed rail project that was primarily sold as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions if all new cars sold by 2035 need to be non-fossil fuel powered ?",
            "It would make more sense to take spent $ 100 billion instead on a direct subsidy for each and every owner of the 6.4 million registered vehicles in California today -- that divvied up comes to $ 15,400 -- when they go to buy a new vehicle as long as it is electric .",
            "If a basic Tesla 3 sells for $ 40,000 today , the subsidy would make the actual cost of the car to a buyer $ 24,600 .",
            "The state could require that they take ownership of the vehicle it is being replaced with and then destroy the car .",
            "At the same time the same $ 15,400 subsidy could be used to buy a used electric vehicle making them affordable to those that ca n't afford new vehicles .",
            "Every registered owner of a gas or diesel powered vehicle could have a one-time $ 15,400 state subsidy waiting for them to get rid of their fossil fuel powered vehicle .",
            "All we have to do is scrap the high speed rail boondoggle .",
            "Better yet , let 's marry green goals that are not going away with reality .",
            "If we are keeping the 2035 date for ending all new vehicle sales of fossil fueled vehicles , let 's not waste the $ 100 billion on a high speed rail project that by the time it is completed by 2040 or so to connect San Francisco with Los Angeles will be rendered white elephant status in terms of reducing our carbon footprint thanks to the 2035 edict on new car sales .",
            "Instead divert $ 7.5 billion into prescribed burns -- the cost of addressing the 16.5 million acres in need of them in the 2018 Little Hoover Commission based on the $ 30 million price tag for prescribed burns for 60,000 acres .",
            "And once the plug is pulled on high speed rail the cap-and-trade funds earmarked to help cover its annual projected operating costs can go toward maintaining a robust wild land and forest management program going forward .",
            "Not only would it save money from the cap-and-trade accounts as well as reduce the need to plunge the state into hock for another $ 80 billion or so on high speed rail construction costs but it would help reduce losses from -- and the costs of fighting -- wildfires .",
            "And the best part we can actually make a real sustainable dent in our carbon footprint that is n't wiped out each year by massive wildfires ."

            "ROCKFORD -- The raging wildfires on the West Coast prompted David Boyles to once again hit the road as a volunteer with the Red Cross .",
            "On Sept. 13 , he and another volunteer from the Rockford chapter packed their things and drove the Red Cross 's Emergency Response Vehicle nearly 30 hours from Rockford to Oregon so Boyles could work as a damage assessment manager .",
            "Since that initial trip to Oregon , Boyles , 64 , has been deployed three times in the last two months .",
            "He is currently stationed in California .",
            "Boyles , of Morrison , which is about 80 miles southwest of Rockford , has been deployed nearly 30 times for the Red Cross in the past eight years , including most recently to Louisiana after Hurricane Laura .",
            "Every day Boyles and his team of nationwide volunteers go out into areas where homes have been damaged or destroyed by fire and make assessments so that the Red Cross can determine how much aid that family needs .",
            "The team has an application on their phones that allows them to mark the location of the home with the address .",
            "Challenges emerge when the internet connection does n't allow the team to mark the location or when damage to the property does n't allow for the address of the home to be determined .",
            "`` We drive down the road and stop in front of foundation after foundation .",
            "Chimney standing , cement steps out front with no house behind it , '' Boyles said .",
            "As of Monday , California has reached `` gigafire '' status , according to the Los Angeles Times .",
            "The term is used to describe the more than 1 million burned or burning acres .",
            "Oregon also has eclipsed the 1 million mark , and some 40,000 people have had to flee their homes since September , according to CNBC .",
            "The deployments over the last two months are unique because of how spread out the damage is .",
            "With multiple fires raging at the same time , it can be overwhelming , Boyles said .",
            "There are physical challenges associated with travel and the work in the field .",
            "That includes constant smoke that burns Boyles ' eyes and forced him to buy his first-ever container of Visine .",
            "In addition to the physical challenges , the first day of any deployment is the toughest emotionally .",
            "Having to witness homes destroyed takes a toll when he and the team think about the people associated with those properties .",
            "`` When you see foundation after foundation and just burnt up trees you always get this sinking feeling of realizing that there are people that are tied to that , '' Boyles said .",
            "`` I 've been trying to locate some of the properties that have been harder to find so I called some of the clients last night and I talked to a gentlemen that had not seen his property yet .",
            "I mean , he was waiting to find out if he had a home to go home to or not . ''",
            "Boyles , a retired manager of operations from the Exelon Nuclear Generating Station located in the Quad Cities , has chosen to spend his time volunteering as a way to give back .",
            "The nearly 30 deployments and 12 - to 14-hour work days have taken a toll on his body but have deepened his appreciation for what victims of disaster have to endure .",
            "`` I 've been exposed to things and people that in my normal life prior to this I never really thought about it that much or understood that they happen , '' he said .",
            "`` You just get exposed to things that broaden your perspective on the world , on life and on people , and it makes it rewarding for you . ''",

            "Oregon 's lawyers stepped up this month to offer free advice to wildfire victims across the state and help them navigate the complicated world of filing insurance claims for everything they lost and to rebuild their lives from the ground up .",
            "More than 1 million acres of Oregon were lost to wildfires this year , in one of the worst seasons the state has seen .",
            "As of Monday , the Holiday Farm Fire in the McKenzie Valley was at 173,393 acres with 96 % containment .",
            "Thousands of homes and structures were lost to the flames , leaving people to sort out their next steps without some of their most precious belongings , and likely the most significant thing they owned : their home .",
            "For most people , their home is their most expensive asset , and trying to get money from insurance companies can be a detailed and convoluted process , said Eugene attorney Clinton Tapper , who has worked with people that have lost their homes in house fires and wildfires .",
            "That is why the Oregon Trial Lawyers Association decided to pull together a series of consultations events , one which was held Sunday at the Lane County Fairgrounds , for wildfire victims to get guidance .",
            "`` Some folks have been treated well -- some have n't , '' said Eugene attorney Lara Johnson , who is president-elect of the association .",
            "`` What we 're trying to do is help people who have had some damage to their homes , whether it be fire or smoke , or if there were expenses incurred .",
            "`` Our goal is n't to get clients -- it 's just to provide general guidance , '' Johnson said .",
            "The lawyers presume that most folks will be treated fairly by their insurance adjustors , she said .",
            "But after hosting a few consultation events across the state , they said that is n't always the case .",
            "Johnson said one man whose insurance policy included fire damage called his adjuster and noted his house was n't burned but had sustained a lot of smoke damage , which would still typically be covered .",
            "`` The adjustor hung up on him and has n't been returning his calls , '' she said .",
            "During the legal events , people are advised on basic steps such as getting a certified copy of their policy , keeping detailed notes on conversations with adjusters and saving receipts for items they 've already had to start replacing .",
            "These actions can make a huge difference in how much money they 're able to get back .",
            "It 's not new for lawyer associations to host these type of events in the wake of disaster , Johnson said .",
            "Lawyers mobilized in the past following 9/11 in New York and Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana to provide the same type of help .",
            "But this is the first one she 's participated in at this scale in Oregon .",

            "Only about 10 people attended the first event in Lane County , Johnson said , but they know so many more were impacted and likely need assistance with the next legal steps .",
            "`` It 's such an intense process , '' Tapper said .",
            "`` It can feel incredibly bureaucratic ...",
            "It 's easy to get angry with that , but when you get angry you make silly mistakes . ''",
            "Tapper said he tries to help people first `` slow down and center '' and figure out how their immediate needs for the next day or week will be taken care of .",
            "Then he advises everyone to get that copy of their policy to look through , and make sure they file their claim as soon as possible , but with a clear understanding of what they lost and what would be covered .",
            "`` The unfortunate reality is a lot of people live paycheck to paycheck , '' he said , so if they lose their homes , they may be hard-pressed and the first offer from insurance may seem like the best one when really their policy allows for four times that .",
            "`` Insurance companies know that , '' he said .",
            "`` That 's why for me , it 's how are we going to get you through today , through the next day and if we go through the process we can get you what you 're fairly owed . ''",
            "He encourages documenting everything by taking notes of conversations in case the adjusters handling their case change , saving receipts , inventory everything in as much possible detail the first time to avoid issues with their claim , and paying attention to how much time has gone by because the typical statute of limitations for payout is two years .",
            "Johnson and Tapper acknowledge it 's a lot for people who have undergone a trauma to go through and hope that despite the low turnout , people will be able to get the resources they needed .",
            "They also are likely to add more consultation events in the near future , Johnson said , including some via Zoom to connect with more people .",

            "According to Diffenbaugh , the Western United States has seen the area burned by wildfires increase approximately tenfold over the last four decades .",

            "Kate Brown and U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden called separately for actions to help Oregon recover from the current fires and prevent them in the future .",
            "At least 10 deaths have been confirmed by the state medical examiner , and the total is likely to increase as search teams begin work in some of the communities devastated by the fires .",
            "Brown did not mention it during her daily briefing , but she put lawmakers on notice she may invoke line-item vetoes to save a net $ 65 million that could be spent on firefighting and related costs .",
            "The Aug. 10 special session of the Legislature cut spending for most agencies -- including the Department of Forestry , the Oregon National Guard and the Oregon State Police , all on the front lines of wildfire fighting -- but also set aside money for potential caseload increases in the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority .",
            "She also urged the Emergency Board , which meets between legislative sessions , to set aside at least $ 150 million for firefighting costs .",
            "No date has been set for that meeting , but legislative committee hearings are scheduled Sept. 21-23 , so it will be sometime then .",
            "The state emergency fund , as a result of action by the special session , has a record $ 200 million .",
            "Other funds subject to board control are not available yet , but would revert to the emergency fund if they are not spent by Nov. 1 .",
            "During her briefing that included officials from several agencies , Brown did announce the creation of a community rebuilding fund with help from the Meyer Memorial Trust , Oregon Community Foundation and Ford Family Foundation .",
            "`` Our fire teams tell me that cooler weather coming in toward the end of this week will be of tremendous help , '' Brown said .",
            "`` But I think we all know we are a long way from recovery . ''",
            "Wyden wades in Meanwhile , in Washington , D.C. , Sen. Wyden urged his colleagues to start working on legislation to create a new version of the Civilian Conservation Corps , allow prescribed fires and promote other means of wildfire prevention .",
            "The corps is modeled on the New Deal agency that between 1933 and 1942 put young men to work in the nation 's forests .",
            "Silver Falls State Park east of Salem is a legacy of the corps .",
            "The new corps would help reduce potential wildfire fuels and stabilize soils .",
            "Wyden and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley completed a two-day tour of wildfire command centers and evacuation shelters Friday and Saturday in Oregon City , Salem , Springfield and Central Point .",
            "They were joined at various stops by U.S. Reps. Kurt Schrader , Peter DeFazio and Greg Walden .",
            "After years of effort , Democrat Wyden and Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho won congressional approval in 2018 for the costs of wildfire fighting to be drawn from its own suppression fund -- estimated now at $ 3 billion -- instead of program budgets of the Forest Service and other land management agencies .",
            "But Wyden , in a speech in the Senate on Monday , said suppression is not enough .",
            "`` This needs to be the day the Senate gets serious about fire prevention as part of a comprehensive effort to fight the climate crisis .",
            "These ideas ought to become law soon , and with broad bipartisan support , '' he said .",

            "Proposal on table Brown also said the Oregon Legislature should have acted on recommendations by her Wildfire Council , contained in Senate Bill 1536 during the 2020 regular session , that would have started Oregon toward more resiliency against wildfires .",
            "The council estimated that it will cost Oregon $ 200 million annually during the next two decades to suppress , mitigate and prevent wildfires .",
            "The bill was n't all about money .",
            "Among its provisions was a requirement for utilities to secure their power lines .",
            "Pacific Gas & Electric was found to be at fault for the 2018 California wildfire that is considered the most devastating in recent times -- until now .",
            "Senate Republican Leader Fred Girod confirmed Monday that he was among those who lost his home in the wildfires .",
            "Girod lives in Lyons , where the fire burned ; his office is in Stayton , which is at the western edge of the Marion County fires but unaffected .",
            "`` Beloved communities in Oregon have been devastated due to multiple wildfires sweeping across the state , '' Girod said in a statement .",
            "`` On a more personal level , the communities near me and in my district have suffered staggering losses , including the complete destruction of cities like Gates and Detroit , and the loss of my home . ''",
            "But Girod also accused Brown of inaction on wildfires .",
            "He said in his statement that Brown could have proposed funding , but did n't , during either of two special legislative sessions June 24 to 26 or Aug. 10 .",
            "Brown did not respond directly during her briefing , and her comments on funding came about 30 minutes after Girod issued his statement .",
            "But she did mention during the briefing that SB 1536 never reached a vote of the Senate , despite clearance by the Legislature 's budget committee , because the Legislature abruptly adjourned the session a few days before the constitutional deadline .",
            "She did not specify why , but Democratic legislative leaders closed it down after Republican walkouts over proposed climate-change legislation deprived lawmakers of the two-thirds majorities required to conduct any business .",
            "Two days before the March 5 ending , Brown testified to a Senate committee on the council bill : `` Doing nothing is not an option .",
            "Studies suggest the comprehensive costs of wildfire are 11 times greater than the immediate costs of firefighting .",
            "`` And by investing in restoration treatments and forest health , Oregon may avoid costly damages while simultaneously creating jobs in rural parts of the state .",
            "`` That is why I am asking you , the Legislature , to invest $ 200 million this session in wildfire prevention , mitigation and suppression -- do n't worry , not all in this bill . ''",

            "`` This is a rare moment in which we are well-positioned to get ahead of the problem .",
            "But that wo n't last for long , '' she predicted .",

            "Wednesday , October 21 , 2020 | Sacramento , CA With California 's worst wildfire season on record still raging , experts from across the state are calling for a $ 2 billion investment in the next year on prevention tactics like prescribed burns and more year-round forest management jobs .",
            "Organizations like the Sierra Business Council say this money will directly impact mountain regions of the state impacted by wildfire year after year , said Brittany Benesi , the nonprofit 's government and community affairs director .",
            "`` We have a need and we have an opportunity to increase community safety , decrease the rate of climate change , enhance environmental resilience and create good jobs and communities that need them , '' Benesi said .",
            "Wildfires in the state this year have burned more than 4 million acres , killed 31 people and destroyed more than 9,000 homes and businesses .",
            "California has invested millions of dollars over the past few years on forest health , including removing trees along highways and campgrounds that were killed by bark beetles .",
            "But experts say more needs to be done , especially with the pace and scale of wildfires growing due to historic fire suppression , climate change and the large population living in wildfire-prone areas .",
            "`` This can only be done with meaningful investment , and we simply ca n't wait any longer , '' Benesi said .",
            "The coalition wants a few major things to happen , all of which involve investing money into fire prevention .",
            "With 57 % of forested land in the state owned by the federal government , the coalition wants Congress to ramp up funding for forest management , while reducing wildfire risk .",
            "There is a federal bill in the works that could increase the amount of prescribed burns , as well as an agreement between the federal government and California to treat one million acres of land over the next five years .",
            "It would also create a 20-year plan for thinning and burning forests .",
            "`` We 're seeing significant impacts economically ...",
            "I think the greater need is to really think about the economic impacts if we do n't do anything , if we do n't move in a direction of using more prescribed fire , '' said Kelly Martin , retired chief of fire and aviation at Yosemite National Park .",
            "While around $ 2.2 billion was allotted this fiscal year to CalFire for fire suppression , only about $ 203,000 was designated to prevention .",
            "And the state 's dedicated fire money for suppression is not likely to decrease in coming years , because fire risk is increasing and so is the chance of death and property loss for the nearly 40 million people living in California .",
            "As a result , the coalition wants the legislature to approve a $ 500 million supplemental appropriation for forest health in January , and an additional $ 1.5 billion to be appropriated for the 2021-22 fiscal year .",
            "At least $ 50 million of those dollars would be for prescribed fire and $ 10 million would go to working with Indigenous tribes on cultural burns , and then $ 25 million in the years after .",

            "`` Indiengous peoples are still kind of sitting by the wayside without any means to really actively engage in the shared stewardship discussion , '' said Bill Tripp , director of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy with the Karuk Tribe , who live at the northern edge of the state .",
            "It 's important that the decision to invest in wildfire prevention comes from lawmakers , because the decision to suppress wildfires in the first place was political , Martin said .",
            "She says social demand must be reflected not with political will , but with action .",
            "`` If the demand really is n't there politically , then it 's really hard for us as federal , state and local agencies to really gain the momentum that we need , '' she said .",
            "`` I really feel that it 's important that we do put the political and social pressure and the demands that can reverse [ course ] and support the larger landscapes that need to be treated . ''",
            "The coalition envisions the first check to come from a mix of cap-and-trade revenue and the general fund .",
            "The dollars could be used as grants for home-hardening , thinning forests , creating year-round wildfire prevention jobs and for prescribed burns .",
            "`` I think that 's squarely in the realm of feasible , especially given the scale of the challenge that we 've seen this year , '' said Paul Mason , vice president of policy and incentives for the Pacific Forest Trust , a non-profit conservation land trust and policy think-tank .",
            "Mason wants the public to understand this potential investment is n't about defunding wildfire suppression .",
            "He says all the fire activity this past summer proved that fire suppression , as well as prevention , is needed to protect homes and human life .",
            "`` It 's like trying to win a football game by only playing defense , '' he said .",
            "`` We really need to be proactive about addressing some of these challenges , especially when the challenges are the result of our active intervention on the landscape for the last century . ''",
            "The $ 1.5 billion demand for 2021-2022 will take more creativity to come up with , Mason said .",
            "But he added that significant investment in wildfire prevention is needed if spending on suppression is to ever decrease .",
            "`` It 's getting impossible to just push this off as one of those issues that we 'll deal with someday , '' he said .",
            "An October 2020 overview of state spending on wildfire prevention and mitigation by the Legislative Analyst 's Office says the legislature could allocate funds from four sources : the general fund , special funds like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund ( which generates $ 3 billion annually ) new taxes or fees , or one-time bonds .",
            "`` If we do n't make a fundamental change in how we 're approaching fire in California , we should expect summers like we had this summer , '' Mason said .",
            "`` It 's just an unsustainable trend .",

            "It was about 66 % contained .",
            "It was sparked by a gender reveal party .",
            "In mid-August , lightning bolts cracked in the skies over Northern and Central California , touching down in grasslands and vineyards .",
            "The National Weather Service warned that the dry lightning striking a parched landscape `` could lead to new wildfire . ''",
            "Since then , thousands of bolts ignited hundreds of fires in California and at least one in Oregon , setting the stage for some of the most destructive wildfires the West Coast states have seen in modern times .",
            "One month later , firefighters are still battling them , and at least 34 people have died in California , Oregon and Washington .",
            "`` What really was jaw dropping for people was the fact that this really changed the paradigm that people have in terms of their sense of security , '' said Oregon Department of Forestry spokesman Jim Gersbach .",
            "`` These burned so close to populated areas , driven by this wind -- basically unstoppable . ''",
            "Before the cluster of lightning strikes , the West 's fire season had been slightly more severe than normal .",
            "In Oregon , officials had decided to not let fires grow , ordering that even small blazes be smothered quickly by aircraft , so throngs of firefighters would n't be needed and potentially spread the coronavirus , Gersbach said .",

            "Normally , the winds that time of year go in the opposite direction .",
            "Those gusts pushed the fires through trees and brush that had been drying out all summer , causing the blazes to explode in size and sending them rushing into towns and rural homes .",
            "Many residents barely had time to flee with just the clothes on their back .",
            "Jones called the weather conditions `` likely a once in a generation event . ''",

            "One burned near Interstate 5 in Oregon not far from the California state line , turning most of the towns of Phoenix and Talent into a blackened landscape littered with the twisted remains of mobile homes and other structures .",
            "The flames were so intense that firefighters sometimes had to retreat , including those facing a blaze threatening Portland 's southeastern suburbs .",
            "`` You ca n't really stand there with a hose when you 've got 30-mile-an-hour winds and dry fuels , '' Gersbach said .",
            "Firefighters from across the nation and Canada have descended on the region to help fight the blazes : There are more than 17,000 in California fighting over two dozen major fires , and more than 6,000 facing about a dozen blazes in Oregon .",

            "LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Firefighters struggling to contain three wildfires near Los Angeles faced another challenging day Saturday as forecasters warned that the risk of new fires was high with temperatures expected to spike and humidity levels to drop across California .",
            "A huge forest fire that prompted evacuations north of Los Angeles flared up Friday afternoon , sending up an enormous cloud of smoke as it headed down to the desert floor and the California aqueduct in the Antelope Valley .",
            "Fire crews managed to stop its movement there but additional evacuations were ordered for the western Antelope Valley .",
            "In one dramatic moment , several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them .",
            "The so-called Lake Fire was just 12 % contained as of Saturday morning , and after threatening more than 5,400 homes , it had charred more than 23 square miles ( 59.5 square kilometers ) of brush and trees .",
            "Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed , including at least five homes .",
            "The blaze was in the Angeles National Forest near Lake Hughes .",
            "Firefighters were struggling in steep , rugged terrain amid scorching temperatures .",
            "The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees ( 44 Celsius ) in the Antelope Valley Saturday , and winds gusting 15-20 mph ( 24-32 kph ) was expected later in the afternoon .",
            "`` In addition to that , we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that 's going to allow for a pyrocumulus ( cloud ) development later today so that will create extreme fire behavior , '' NWS meteorologist Matt Mehle said .",
            "Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend , with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state .",
            "There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts , fire officials said There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa .",
            "It churned through 2.3 square miles ( 5.96 square kilometers ) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes .",
            "Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday .",
            "Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire .",
            "He was identified as Osmin Palencia , 36 , and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started .",
            "Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him .",
            "Another blaze came dangerously close to a neighborhood in the city of Corona , east of Los Angeles , before crews controlled it .",

            "LOS ANGELES -- Firefighters struggled to contain three wildfires near Los Angeles on Saturday as forecasters warned that the risk of new fires was high with temperatures expected to spike and humidity levels to drop across California .",
            "A huge forest fire that prompted evacuations north of Los Angeles flared up around noon , sending up a cloud of smoke as it headed toward thick , dry brush in the Angeles National Forest .",
            "Although it was burning into forest land , evacuation orders remained in effect for the western Antelope Valley because erratic winds in the forecast could push the fire toward homes , fire spokesman Jake Miller said .",
            "Fire crews managed to stop the fire 's movement down to the desert floor when it flared up Friday afternoon .",
            "In one dramatic moment , several firefighters ran to safety when a longhorn bull that was apparently escaping the blaze charged at them .",
            "The Lake Fire was just 12 % contained as of Saturday morning , and after threatening more than 5,400 homes , it had charred more than 23 square miles ( 59.5 square kilometers ) of brush and trees .",
            "Fire officials said 21 buildings had been destroyed , including at least five homes .",

            "The National Weather Service warned temperatures could hit 111 degrees ( 44 Celsius ) in the Antelope Valley Saturday , and winds gusting 15-20 mph ( 24-32 kph ) was expected later in the afternoon .",
            "`` In addition to that , we have a very unstable air mass over the Lake Fire that 's going to allow for a pyrocumulus ( cloud ) development later today so that will create extreme fire behavior , '' meteorologist Matt Mehle said .",
            "Record-breaking heat is possible through the weekend , with triple-digit temperatures and unhealthy air predicted for many parts of the state .",
            "There also was a chance of isolated thunderstorms worsening the fire threat by creating dry lightning and strong downdrafts , fire officials said There was no containment of a blaze that blackened foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa .",
            "It churned through 2.3 square miles ( 5.96 square kilometers ) of brush on Thursday and was moving away from homes .",
            "Evacuation orders issued to residents were lifted early Friday .",
            "Azusa police said they were looking for a homeless man suspected of starting the fire .",
            "He was identified as Osmin Palencia , 36 , and was last known to be living in a riverbed encampment near the site where the fire started .",
            "Police said Palencia was believed to be violent and urged people to use caution if they see him .",
            "Another blaze came dangerously close to a neighborhood in the city of Corona , east of Los Angeles , before crews controlled it .",
            "And a Northern California fire in the community of Sloughhouse , near Sacramento , burned about 500 acres ( 202 hectares ) before firefighters stopped its forward spread ."

            "It had several record-breaking heatwaves , but the fires did not necessarily follow the locations with the highest temperatures .",
            "What 2020 did have was heat and dryness hitting simultaneously .",
            "When even a moderate drought and heatwave hit a region at the same time , along with wind to fan the flames , it becomes a powerful force that can fuel megafires .",
            "That 's what we 've been seeing in California , Colorado , and Oregon this year .",

            "LOS ANGELES -- California 's power grid operator delivered a blistering rebuke Monday to the state 's Public Utilities Commission , blaming the agency for rotating power outages -- the first since the 2001 energy crisis -- and warning of bigger blackouts to come .",
            "In their first public comments since the blackouts began Friday evening , officials at the California Independent System Operator described a `` perfect storm '' of conditions that caused demand to exceed available supply : scorching temperatures in California and across the western United States , diminished output from renewable sources and fossil-fueled power plants affected by the weather , and in some cases plants going offline unexpectedly when electricity was needed most .",
            "But Stephen Berberich , the grid operator 's president , said the state could have been prepared for that perfect storm if only the Public Utilities Commission had ordered utility companies to line up sufficient power supplies .",
            "During the grid operator 's board meeting Monday , Berberich faulted the commission for failing to ensure adequate power capacity on hot summer evenings , when electricity from the state 's growing fleet of rooftop solar panels and sprawling solar farms rapidly drops to zero but demand for air conditioning remains high .",
            "It 's a challenge that will only intensify as California adds more solar panels and wind turbines to meet its targets of 60 % renewable electricity by 2030 and 100 % emissions-free power by 2045 .",
            "`` For many years , we have pointed out to the ( Public Utilities Commission ) that there was inadequate power available during the net peak , '' Berberich said , referring to the evening period when solar production dries up but cooling demand remains high .",
            "`` The situation we are in could have been avoided . ''",
            "He added , `` It 's near certain that we will be forced to ask the utilities to cut off power to millions today to balance supply and demand -- today , tomorrow and perhaps beyond . ''",
            "Asked about the grid operator 's criticism , commission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said the agency is `` working with our sister agencies to better understand why this occurred . ''",
            "`` The question we 're tackling is why certain resources were not available , '' she said in an email .",
            "Customers of Southern California Edison , Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric have been affected by the outages .",
            "Several municipal electric utilities operate their own systems , including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , which has been able to share excess power with the rest of the state .",
            "Even before this week 's heat wave , which saw temperatures reach a record-shattering 130 degrees in Death Valley , California 's power system was in flux .",
            "So much solar power is generated during the afternoon that California sometimes pays other states to take its excess supply .",
            "But there are fewer gas-fired power plants than in past years to pick up the slack each evening .",
            "And coal plants have been shutting down across the West because of competition from cheaper natural gas and renewables , meaning there may be less energy available for California to import in a pinch .",
            "All of those changes are manageable , experts say .",
            "Several studies have shown that running a large power grid using mostly renewable energy is technically possible and could save money because solar and wind power have gotten so cheap .",
            "`` We 're moving forward with a low-carbon grid , '' Mary Leslie , a member of the Independent System Operator 's board of governors , said during Monday 's meeting .",
            "`` I think the direction is really clear , and we 're not going backward .",
            "We 're going to move forward . ''",
            "But this week 's energy emergency dramatizes the urgency of filling the evening gap .",
            "Last year the Public Utilities Commission ordered Edison , PG&E and other utilities to buy thousands of megawatts of new power capacity .",
            "Most if not all of those resources are expected to be four-hour lithium-ion batteries that can store solar energy during the afternoon and distribute it when the sun goes down .",
            "But none of those batteries are online yet -- and the need will only grow when the massive Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant begins shutting down in 2024 .",
            "Jim Caldwell , a former assistant general manager at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power , said the Public Utilities Commission should be acting much more aggressively to bring new supplies online .",
            "He echoed the grid operator 's call to look beyond batteries , and to build enough additional solar power to keep those batteries charged .",
            "`` Knowing what we know and where we 're going as a state , knowing that we 're going to need a lot of investments in renewables in order to meet the climate goals , what the hell 's going on ? ''",
            "Caldwell asked .",
            "`` We know it 's cheaper , we can get the ( federal ) tax credits now .",
            "We ... need the economic activity . ''",
            "The Independent System Operator , which runs the power grid for most of the state , warned in September that California could face evening power shortages as early as summer 2020 , with much larger shortfalls coming in later years as several Los Angeles-area coastal gas plants retire .",
            "One of the system operator 's top officials said at the time that the summer 2020 gap could probably be resolved by importing power from other states , `` as long as it 's not hot across the West . ''",
            "But this week , it is extremely hot across the West , with Las Vegas , Los Angeles , Phoenix , Sacramento and Seattle all breaking daily temperature records Sunday , and high temperatures expected to continue for several more days .",
            "Coupled with stay-at-home orders necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic , the heat wave could be even deadlier than usual for people stuck at home without air conditioning -- a dynamic that may be worsened by California 's rotating power outages .",
            "Officials at the Independent System Operator described a mad dash to secure any available power supplies and reduce demand .",
            "Berberich said utilities in the Pacific Northwest have agreed to export some excess electricity to California , and the Department of Defense and other major energy users have agreed to consume less during peak periods .",
            "The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation warned over the weekend that it was releasing emergency flows through Glen Canyon Dam on the Utah-Arizona border in part to generate more electricity for California , and that boaters on the Colorado River should prepare for rapid changes in river flow .",
            "Utility companies , meanwhile , could do little except ask their customers to conserve power as much as they could from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. , when electricity demand is typically highest .",
            "On Sunday , the Independent System Operator preemptively called a `` flex alert '' for every day through Wednesday .",
            "`` It 's 3 pm .",
            "That means it 's time to set the thermostat to 78 ( degrees ) , avoid using large appliances , and turn off unnecessary '' lights , Southern California Edison tweeted Monday afternoon , linking to a page with more detailed advice on saving energy .",
            "Although the rotating blackouts have been disruptive , they 're not wildly outside the realm of what power grid operators typically consider acceptable -- at least so far .",
            "It would be exorbitantly expensive to build enough power plants to ensure the electricity never goes off -- and some of those plants might sit idle for years at a time .",
            "So instead , the U.S. utility industry has long followed a standard of having enough power on call to ensure this type of outage does n't happen more than once every 10 years .",
            "The last time California was forced to implement rotating blackouts because of insufficient energy supply was nearly 20 years ago , during the 2001 energy crisis , as opposed to more recent intentional outages because of fire safety .",
            "But these blackouts may strike a raw nerve for many PG&E customers after the utility 's decision last year to shut down power to millions of people in an effort to prevent its aging and poorly maintained transmission lines from igniting wildfires .",
            "In a letter to his own top energy officials Monday , Gov.",
            "Gavin Newsom described the blackouts as `` unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation 's largest and most innovative state . ''",
            "He instructed them to investigate what had gone wrong and take several steps to better prepare for future heat waves .",
            "`` Energy service shutoffs are simply too disruptive , and we must do more to prevent them in the future , '' Newsom wrote .",
            "Berberich said the Independent System Operator accepted responsibility for failing to give Californians more notice about the power supply emergency before rolling blackouts began this weekend .",
            "`` We thought there would be adequate power to supply the demand .",

            "The National Weather Service issued a rare `` particularly dangerous situation '' Red Flag Warning for the Santa Clarita Valley and the Los Angeles and Ventura county mountains , '' [ d ] ue to the combination of extremely dry vegetation , strong winds , and very dry air especially Thursday morning into Thursday afternoon .

            "Normally , Northern California has received enough rain and mountain snow by this time of year to end the fire season .",
            "Ordinarily , California would be moving into the heart of its rainy season , but a vast area of high pressure over the West has been shunting storms well to the north of the state , causing it to fall deeper into a drought .",

            "- - - The forecast for the rest of the month is equally worrisome .",

            "`` Every wind event is going to be very impactful for us because fuels are very dry and very receptive to fire , '' Rolinski said .",
            "The 2020 wildfire season in California has been unrelenting because of record warmth , a deepening drought and an abundance of lightning strikes and strong offshore wind events .",
            "Santa Ana winds triggered major fires in Orange County in late October , forcing tens of thousands to evacuate on short notice .",

            "August , September and October ranked as the state 's hottest months since records began in 1895 .",

            "Fighting the flames from the air was key to the strategy , with 35 air tankers and 200 helicopters used , Forest Service spokesperson Kaari Carpenter said .",
            "Yet by Aug. 30 , following the deaths of firefighters , including four aviators , fire officials in Boise warned that long-term fatigue was setting in .",

            "The 1,800-acre Easy Fire , which threatened the library and nearby Simi Valley homes , ignited Oct. 30 , 2019 , when an insulator attached to a Southern California Edison high-voltage transmission line swung into a steel power pole during windy , dry conditions , the Ventura County Fire Department said in a statement .",
            "At the time , the utility reported to state regulators that its equipment may have been involved in the fire , which damaged two buildings .",

            "SANTA CRUZ , Calif. - California wildfires were slowly being corralled Friday as cooler , humid weather and reinforcements aided firefighters and tens of thousands of people were allowed back home after days of death and destruction .",
            "In the past two days , evacuation orders were lifted for at least 50,000 people in the San Francisco Bay Area and wine country , officials with the state fire agency , Cal Fire , said Thursday evening .",
            "At their peak , some 170,000 people were under evacuation orders .",
            "In heavily damaged areas , crews were working to restore electricity and water so more people could return to their homes , Santa Cruz County Chief Deputy Chris Clark said .",
            "Evacuation orders for more than 20,000 people were lifted over the past 24 hours in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties .",
            "And more good news : Clark said Friday that no one returning home had been burglarized while they were gone .",
            "Clark also added that three missing people had been accounted for , though he was looking into one missing person report .",
            "By Friday evening , Cal Fire said that the CZU August Lightning Complex Fire in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties had burned about 83,133 acres and was 27 % contained .",
            "A total of 831 structures were destroyed , and 554 of those were homes .",
            "All but 11 structures were located in Santa Cruz County .",
            "A total of 13,000 structures remained threatened .",
            "`` We expect really good work today , '' said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mark Brunton .",
            "Meanwhile , fire crews found an odd discovery while mopping up spot fires near the Boulder Creek Golf Club on Thursday .",
            "They found an explosive device that appeared to be a pipe bomb inside a toolbox .",
            "The sheriff 's bomb squad safely detonated the device .",
            "Around the state , hundreds of wildfires -- coming months earlier in the season than expected -- have already killed at least seven people , burned more than 2,000 square miles and pushed firefighter resources to the breaking point .",
            "Two are among the largest wildfires in recent state history .",
            "But a heatwave eased this week , and in the past few days cooler , more humid weather patterns have slowed the spread of three massive complexes of wildfires in the north .",
            "In addition , personnel , aircraft and bulldozers have been arriving from other states and California National Guard troops have joined the fight , authorities said .",
            "In the eastern San Francisco Bay Area , the SCU Lightning Complex Fire that has burned in seven counties had burned about 374,471 acres by Friday and was 40 % contained .",
            "Cal Fire said three first responders and two civilians were injured in the fire , but the agency did not elaborate on the extent of those injuries .",
            "Further north , the LNU Lightning Complex Fire had burned more than 372,344 acres and was 35 % contained by Friday .",
            "That fire complex , the site of five deaths , still threatened 30,500 homes and other buildings after destroying 1,080 .",
            "Cal Fire noted that burned out unstable wooden bridges , burned asphalt , trees and power lines have been falling down and these issues will have to be addressed before letting people move back in .",
            "Still , there were areas that were deemed safe for `` repopulation . ''",
            "Firefighters and utility workers were clearing areas for returning residents .",
            "In the heart of wine country , evacuation orders in Napa and Sonoma counties were lifted Wednesday for about 35,000 people who had been told to leave after lightning ignited dozens of blazes more than a week ago starting the LNU fires .",
            "Cal Fire said there still was `` extreme fire behavior '' and portions of the three-pronged fire continued to advance in several directions .",
            "Even after the wildfires are contained , thousands of firefighters will have to remain on the firelines to douse smoldering timber and hot spots to prevent flareups .",

            "The cameras are part of the ALERTWildfire camera network , built by UC San Diego 's Scripps Institution of Oceanography , the University of Nevada , Reno and the University of Oregon .",
            "The network has become a vital firefighting tool helping first responders confirm and monitor wildfires from ignition through containment .",
            "The ALERTWildfire cameras play a critical role for California as the state grapples with ever-intensifying fire seasons .",
            "In 2020 , the Operations Southern California Center ( OSCC ) -- the cooperative organization that includes agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service , Department of the Interior and CAL FIRE -- predicts temperatures across California to be higher than normal with lower than normal rainfall through December , creating conditions ideal for wildfires .",
            "The high-definition ALERTWildfire cameras are able to pan , tilt , zoom and perform 360-degree sweeps approximately every two minutes with 12 high-definition frames per sweep .",
            "The cameras also provide 24-hour monitoring with near-infrared night vision capabilities .",
            "Each camera can view as far as 60 miles on a clear day and 120 miles on a clear night .",
            "Fire agencies and utilities can access actionable real-time data to confirm 911 calls , triangulate on the location of fires at their earliest stages and make critical decisions during and after wildfires .",
            "`` The cameras have been a game changer for us in San Diego , '' said CAL FIRE San Diego County Unit Chief Tony Mecham .",
            "`` The cameras have given us real-time situational awareness and have allowed us to make informed decisions much quicker than we used to .",
            "It used to take 20 to 30 minutes for our fire ground commanders to get to fires and make decisions , and now with the cameras we are reacting within seconds of the first report .",
            "That extra time is significant when it comes to moving resources or needing to start evacuations .",

            "The ALERTWildfire Camera Network got its start as ALERTTahoe , a pilot project in the Lake Tahoe region launched by the Nevada Seismological Laboratory at the University of Nevada , Reno .",
            "Built on the backbone of the networking technology used in earthquake detection systems , the ALERTTahoe network expanded rapidly .",
            "When UC San Diego and the University of Oregon became partners , the network became ALERTWildfire .",
            "The efficacy of the network to confirm and monitor wildfires was readily apparent and interagency investment created a surge in camera numbers as they quickly became an essential tool .",
            "In California , the ALERTWildfire network expansion began in 2017 with 16 cameras in San Diego County funded through San Diego Gas & Electric .",
            "From there , additional investment and support to expand the network has come from organizations including Pacific Gas & Electric , Southern California Edison , and most recently CAL FIRE , which contributed $ 5 million for the installation and network support of 100 additional cameras throughout the state of California that were installed this spring , summer and fall in anticipation of a potentially dangerous 2020 fire season .",
            "`` The ALERTWildfire camera network provides actionable real-time data that allows first responders to marshal resources to fight fires in the incipient phase , '' said Scripps Oceanography geoscientist Neal Driscoll , director of the ALERTWildfire program at UC San Diego .",
            "`` These cameras save critical time by allowing rapid confirmation of 911 calls and accurate location of new fires using the ALERTWildfire web-based interface , time that would otherwise be spent sending engines to mountaintops or launching aircraft to confirm fire ignition and location . ''",
            "In the last four months , the number of ALERTWildfire cameras has nearly doubled , with growth primarily in California .",
            "The team has been on track , and installed the 610th camera in California in mid-October 2020 .",
            "Currently the ALERTWildfire network also has 41 cameras in Nevada , nine in Oregon , six in Idaho , and one in Washington state .",
            "The to-the-minute information provided by ALERTWildfire allows for enhanced situational awareness that helps first responders adapt quickly to scale fire resources up or down and monitor fire activity .",
            "The ALERTWildfire team is working rapidly , with interagency support and funding , to deploy as many cameras as possible as conditions become more conducive to fires .",
            "`` In Kern County , ALERTWildfire has provided us the early confirmation necessary to increase the number of firefighters and resources deployed to fires located in communities vulnerable to high-risk wildfires , '' says Kern County Battalion Chief Zach Wells , `` We get to the fires much earlier than we did last year based on the increased situational awareness the cameras provide .",
            "We also share the publicly available camera feeds with firefighters responding to the scene to help them better observe and orient themselves to assist with route selection and evolving conditions . ''",
            "ALERTWildfire is more than cameras on mountaintops .",
            "Behind the scenes , its cyber-infrastructure is created and managed by UN Reno and UC San Diego 's Jacobs School of Engineering .",
            "They provide ALERTWildfire with networking , an interactive user interface , `` Big Data '' management , storage and backups as well as next-generation data processing and wildfire visualization .",
            "As the camera network grows , so does the amount of raw data recorded and processed .",
            "One year of current camera data usage exceeds one million gigabytes .",
            "That amount of data is expected to double annually as the ALERTWildfire Camera Network continues to expand .",
            "`` This project brings together a highly interdisciplinary team of faculty , students , and staff at UC San Diego , '' said Falko Kuester , ALERTWildfire team member and professor at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego .",
            "`` The team includes members with expertise in earth systems science , computer science and engineering , electrical and computer engineering , mechanical and aerospace engineering , structural engineering , mathematics and physics . ''",
            "Currently , ALERTWildfire Camera Network growth comes with greater urgency , as wildfires continue to increase in frequency and intensity .",
            "Hotter daytime and warmer nighttime temperatures throughout the year , periodic drought , episodic dry wind events including Santa Anas and Diablos , and stressed and degraded native habitats are some of the many climate change impacts that directly contribute to California 's increased fire risk .",
            "California 's Fourth Climate Change Assessment , released in 2018 and edited by Scripps Oceanography research meteorologist Dan Cayan , found that by the year 2100 , if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise , using traditional fire abatement practices , the average area burned by wildfires would increase 77 percent and the frequency of extreme wildfires burning more than 25,000 acres would increase by nearly 50 percent .",
            "California 's recent catastrophic fires showcase the importance of having a robust camera network .",
            "The CZU Lightning Complex Fires outside of Santa Cruz caused devastating losses for the community , and cameras .",
            "While the cameras are designed to be resilient , five ALERTWildfire cameras also were burned and rendered inoperable , including the Bonny Doon ALERTWildlfire camera in Santa Cruz County .",
            "Three of those cameras have since been replaced , and once all areas are safe to access , the remaining damaged cameras will also be brought back online ALERTWildfire cameras can be viewed by the public at any time at alertwildfire.org .",
            "The website shows cameras by geographical region , and once a camera is selected , users can create time lapses or explore other cameras in the area .",
            "Each ALERTWildfire partner plays an essential role in broadening the network reach and every new camera is a tool to save lives , property , infrastructure and habitat ."

        "sentences": [
            "President Donald Trump reversed himself Friday , approving a package of wildfire disaster relief for California hours after officials from his administration had explained why the state should not receive the aid .",
            "The abrupt turnaround came after the president spoke with California Gov.",
            "Gavin Newsom , a Democrat , and Rep. Kevin McCarthy , a Republican and the House minority leader , with the White House saying the men `` presented a convincing case '' for the state receiving the aid .",
            "The disaster relief aid covers six major wildfires that scorched more than 1.8 million acres of land , destroyed thousands of structures and caused at least three deaths last month .",
            "`` Just got off the phone with President Trump , who has approved our Major Disaster Declaration request , '' Newsom said in a statement .",
            "`` Grateful for his quick response . ''",
            "The relief package adds to the 68 fire-related aid packages for California that Trump has approved during his tenure : 61 for firefighting , five for disaster relief and two for support of emergency services .",
            "California has suffered a series of huge fires since August , when freak lightning storms ignited hundreds of blazes , some of which grew to be the largest in modern state history .",
            "Subsequent fires in September tore through parts of the Sierra Nevada and wine country north of San Francisco .",
            "Earlier on Friday , Judd Deere , a White House spokesperson , referred to the Federal Emergency Management Agency when he said aid for the September fires `` was not supported by the relevant data that states must provide for approval , and the president concurred with the FEMA administrator 's recommendation . ''",
            "Your daily US politics newsletter Lizzie Litzow , the agency 's press secretary , said damage assessments of some of the fires that started in early September , which included one of the largest fires in California 's history , `` were not of such severity and magnitude to exceed the combined capabilities of the state , affected local governments , voluntary agencies and other responding federal agencies . ''",
            "The initial rejection was unusual but not unprecedented : A 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service found that from 1974 to 2016 , presidents denied requests for disaster relief an average of 2.9 times per year during nonelection years and 2.1 times in a year with a presidential election .",
            "Since the enactment in 1953 of a federal disaster relief act , presidents have been authorised to issue declarations that provide states with federal assistance in response to natural and man-made incidents .",
            "The requests are judged based on criteria that take into account damage to infrastructure , existing insurance coverage and a state 's population , among others .",
            "But the president ultimately has the authority to approve or reject a disaster aid request regardless whether the criteria are met .",
            "Newsom said Friday that he would appeal the denial -- and had apparent success in persuading the president during their afternoon phone call .",
            "Trump 's reversal on the aid came after members of his party in California urged him to change his mind .",
            "`` I am writing to respectfully request your reconsideration , '' state Sen. Andreas Borgeas , a Republican , wrote Trump in a letter Friday .",
            "The Creek fire , which ravaged parts of Borgeas ' district , `` caused unprecedented damage during these most unprecedented times , '' he said .",
            "While the state did not include a specific dollar amount in its request , Newsom had written that because of a recession induced by the coronavirus pandemic , California went from a projected $ 5.6 ( # 4.3 ) billion budget surplus to a $ 54.3 ( # 42 ) billion projected deficit .",
            "`` California 's economy is suffering in a way we have not seen since the 2009 Great Recession , '' he said in the request , which came in the form of a letter to Trump .",
            "Infrastructure damage estimates from the fires had exceeded $ 229 ( # 177.3 ) million , Newsom said , and `` the severity and magnitude of these fires continue to cause significant impacts to the state and to the affected local jurisdictions , such that recovery efforts remain beyond the state 's capabilities . ''",
            "The handling of wildfires has become highly politicised during Trump 's presidency , aggravating tensions between the conservative administration and one of America 's most liberal states .",
            "California has sued the president on dozens of issues ranging from the environment to immigration .",
            "Last year , the president threatened to cut off funding for wildfire relief unless California improved the management of its forests .",
            "`` Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that , with proper Forest Management , would never happen , '' Trump tweeted in January 2019 .",
            "`` Unless they get their act together , which is unlikely , I have ordered FEMA to send no more money . ''",
            "That threat from Trump alarmed both Republicans and Democrats in the state .",
            "Miles Taylor , a former senior Trump administration official who has endorsed Joe Biden 's presidential campaign , said in August that Trump 's reluctance to aid California was overtly political .",
            "`` He told us to stop giving money to people whose houses had burned down from a wildfire because he was so ragefull that people in the state of California did n't support him and that politically it was n't a base for him , '' Taylor says in a campaign video .",
            "However , many of the largest fires in California over the past four years have ravaged areas that tend to vote Republican .",
            "Wildfire experts say Trump 's analysis of the causes of the blazes is problematic because most of California 's forests are on land owned by the federal government and their maintenance largely falls under the responsibility of his administration .",
            "As wildfires have become hotter , more intense and more destructive in recent years , liberals and conservatives have been locked in a debate over the reasons .",
            "During a visit to California in September , Trump said `` I do n't think science knows '' what is happening when the state 's secretary for natural resources pressed him on the changing climate .",
            "`` One camp is saying it 's all climate change-driven , and the other saying it 's all forest management , '' said Malcolm North , a forest ecologist at the University of California , Davis .",
            "`` The reality is that it 's both .",
            "I get kind of frustrated at this all-or-nothing type of approach . ''",
            "Newsom last month requested the disaster declaration were statewide hazard mitigation as well as public assistance for seven counties .",
            "The six fires targeted under the declaration include the Valley fire in San Diego , the El Dorado fire in San Bernardino , the Slater fire in Siskiyou , the Oak fire in Mendocino , the Bobcat fire in Los Angeles and the Creek fire in Fresno and Madera , Ferguson said .",
            "The state this year has suffered four of its five largest wildfires in modern history .",
            "The Creek fire that started 4 September is among the largest fires in California history , burning 344,000 acres as of Friday .",
            "The fire , the scene of dramatic helicopter rescues , has destroyed more than 850 buildings , is threatening thousands more and has forced more than 24,000 people to evacuate .",
            "It is 60 per cent contained .",
            "Managing wildfires has become an ongoing task for firefighters , officials and residents .",
            "This year , more than 8,500 wildfires have burned more than 4.1 million acres in California , Cal Fire said in its statewide fire summary Thursday .",
            "At least 31 people have died in those fires , the agency said .",
            "The threat of more fires this year continues to haunt the state .",
            "With record-breaking temperatures and high winds this week , large parts of Northern California were placed under `` red flag warnings , '' and the state 's largest utility has cut power to more than 50,000 households in an effort to reduce the possibility that its equipment could ignite new fires .",
            "On Friday , firefighters rushed to extinguish yet another fire that threatened homes on the hillsides near the San Francisco airport .",

            "Harms said that this `` is n't uncommon , '' ; but the difference that we see this year is caused by the immense number of fires , how much land has been burned , and how much smoke has been produced .",
            "The largest effect that West Michigan is seeing from these fires , according to Harms , has been this elevated smoke .",
            "This smoke has caused several days this September , specifically the week of Sept. 14 , in which the sun was shining , but almost seemed `` cloudy . ''",
            "This resulted in a haze .",
            "Harms said that this haze makes the sunrise and sunsets very `` unique , as it 's often a deep red ; the sun appears like a red disc , surrounded by a red/blue gradient . ''",
            "This `` haze '' also allows residents of Western Michigan to be able to look directly at the sun , and , because of this smoke , not have their eyes burn because it is not too bright .",
            "Harms reports that , fortunately , the smoke did not mix to the surface , and the only effect was elevated smoke that was often visible and occasionally noticeable .",
            "If the smoke were to mix , it could have resulted in worsen effects , similar to those seen out West , including decreased air quality .",
            "When looking at the increase in natural disasters due to climate change , one ca n't help but worry that something similar may happen in their own backyard .",
            "Harms reports that Grand Rapids is in the midst of its `` wettest five year period on record . ''",
            "This has caused an increase in water levels in the Great Lakes with last year having a statewide average precipitation of 41.8 inches .",
            "So one is definitely seeing the effects of climate change in West Michigan .",
            "Are similar wildfires to those out West likely ?",
            "Probably not .",
            "As stated earlier , the majority of those fires are a result of human error , and few , as of right now , are naturally caused .",
            "According to Harms , what we can do to help prevent future wildfires is to `` listen to weather , park and other officials and avoid doing any activity involving potential flame or explosion when the conditions are windy and dry . ''",
            "We can continue to expect natural disasters like these to occur due to climate change and human activity , unless we do something .",
            "If we do n't act now , there may be no time left .",
            "Not only can we help prevent wildfires in Michigan , but we can aid those out West .",
            "According to Professor Faber , we live in a `` chemical world , so we have to think about the things we 're putting out into the atmosphere . ''",
            "One can do simple activities such as reducing their electricity use , utilizing public transport , use energy efficient-products , and of course , reduce , reuse , and recycle , in order to reduce their ecological footprint , which , in turn , will reduce pollution .",
            "Some ways that students can do this from home include donating to organizations that help the victims , becoming more educated , signing petitions , and spreading the word .",

            "A large wildfire burning across three eastern Sierra Nevada mountain counties exploded into a highly dangerous fire tornado Saturday , around the time federal forecasters issued a dire and unusual warning .",
            "The Loyalton Fire started Friday at about 4:30 p.m. near Mount Ina Coolbirth in Sierra County , and on Saturday morning it had burned 2,000 acres in the area .",
            "By late afternoon , the wildfire had grown to an estimated 20,000 acres and was raging in parts of Sierra , Lassen and Plumas counties .",
            "As the fire grew amid extreme heat and intense winds , it sent up a tall column of smoke that appears to have formed into a fire-fueled tornado -- similar to the one seen during the 2018 Carr Fire in Redding .",
            "The National Weather Service in Reno observed the menacing smoke column and detected rotation on radar , prompting it to issue an hour-long tornado warning shortly after 2:30 p.m. .",
            "It may be the first time the weather service has issued a tornado warning for a wildfire .",
            "`` We really do n't have any other product for that type of situation , '' said Wendell Hohmann , a meteorologist for the weather service .",
            "`` We decided to put a tornado warning out on it and emphasize the significance . ''",
            "Hohmann said the formation of the fire tornado was aided by high temperatures and atmospheric instability .",
            "`` That instability that then promotes fire growth promotes that column to build up like it did today , '' he said .",
            "`` And then , secondly , we had the right wind conditions , so the storm was able to rotate . ''",
            "The fire was 5 % contained and had not destroyed any structures or injured people as of 5 p.m. , said Joe Flannery , a spokesman for the Tahoe National Forest , where part of the fire was burning .",
            "But various evacuation orders were in place across the three counties as the blaze tore through a basin dotted with grass , sagebrush and juniper .",
            "`` It is burning in an area that has n't seen fire for quite some time , '' Flannery said .",
            "Hundreds of firefighters were battling the fire , but their jobs were made even harder by the fact that the area had not burned in a long time as well as steep , rocky terrain and some barbed wire on range land , he said .",

            "Firefighters already battling the blaze in steep , rugged terrain in scorching heat faced more hurdles Saturday when hundreds of lightning strikes and winds up to 15 mph ( 24 kph ) pushed the flames uphill .",
            "`` We set up a containment line at the top of the hills so the fire does n't spill over to the other side and cause it to spread , but it was obviously difficult given the erratic wind and some other conditions , '' said fire spokesman Jake Miller .",

            "Fire officials said they 'd never seen a fire move so fast in forestland -- 15 miles a day .",
            "On Wednesday , a wildfire in Plumas National Forest northeast of San Francisco spread 25 miles in a day and devoured an estimated 400 square miles .",
            "In between those events , a massive fire in Monterey County doubled in size overnight , trapping 14 firefighters who had to deploy their emergency shelters ; one was critically injured .",
            "They are only the latest examples of what a half-dozen fire experts agreed is more extreme fire behavior driven by drought and warming temperatures they attribute to climate change .",
            "Among the most concerning developments is that fast-moving wildfires leave less time for warnings or evacuations .",
            "Recently `` we have seen multiple fires expand by tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours , and 30 years or more ago that just was n't fire behavior that we saw , '' said Jacob Bendix , a professor of geography and the environment at Syracuse University who studies wildfires .",
            "Hotter temperatures , longer fire seasons and an estimated 140 million dead trees from a five-year drought mean that `` fires in California are moving faster and growing larger , '' said University of Utah fire expert Philip Dennison .",
            "Mike Flannigan , who directs the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science at Canada 's University of Alberta , remembers the first report of a fire-created thunderstorm in 1986 .",
            "`` They were rare events , and now they 've become commonplace , '' he said .",

            "`` `` The fires are behaving in such a way that we 've not seen . ''",
            "The phenomenon is n't restricted to California .",
            "Doug Grafe , chief of Fire Protection at the Oregon Department of Forestry , said it was unprecedented in his state for fires this week to spread from the crest of the Cascade Mountains into the valleys below , and so quickly , `` carrying tens of miles in one period of an afternoon and not slowing down in the evening -- ( there is ) absolutely no context for that in this environment . ''",

            "Labor Day weekend brought record-breaking temperatures across the state that exacerbated what already are drought conditions in a large swath of the state .",
            "On Thursday , a Northern California wildfire was threatening thousands of homes after winds whipped it into a monster that incinerated houses in a small mountain community and killed at least three people .",
            "University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West .",
            "The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy , which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume , `` creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm , '' Flannigan said .",
            "The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus , which may or may not produce lightning , and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze .",

            "The Creek Fire produced at least two firenadoes that appeared to touch down Saturday , he said , one straddling an access road to a popular campground at Mammoth Pool Reservoir where 214 people became trapped .",

            "`` It really is kind of this vicious cycle that it gets into , and that 's when the fire really takes off and becomes these unstoppable infernos . ''",

            "`` Until it happens in your own backyard , you feel it 's very tangential , '' said Kimiko Barrett , a wildfire researcher at Headwaters Economics , a nonprofit research group .",
            "`` You do n't think of wildfire risk as something that will happen to you , until it does . ''",
            "Some of the communities that have taken the strongest steps to deal with wildfires did so only after suffering their own tragedies .",
            "In 1990 , after the Painted Cave Fire hit Santa Barbara , California , burning 427 homes and killing one person , the nearby community of Montecito took action .",
            "The local fire protection district now works with residents to harden homes against fire , strategically thinning out native shrubs on private property and requiring changes in building codes , such as wider driveways for fire engines .",
            "Those efforts were tested in the Thomas Fire in 2017 , when high winds brought flames to Montecito 's doorstep .",
            "This time , only seven houses were destroyed by fire .",
            "But even when a community does suffer from wildfire , the pressure to rebuild quickly , and without costly new regulations , is often intense .",
            "In addition , building codes for new construction only go so far , because they do n't address the millions of homes already built .",
            "Consider the Camp Fire that devastated Paradise , California , in 2010 , killing 85 people .",
            "One analysis found that about 51 % of the 350 single-family homes built to California 's new codes escaped damage .",
            "But of the 12,100 homes built before then , only 18 % were undamaged .",
            "Retrofitting millions of existing homes can be expensive .",
            "For instance , single-pane windows are at risk of breaking from the heat of a fire , allowing embers in .",
            "But replacing those windows with sturdier glass can potentially cost $ 10,000 for a single home .",
            "In California , legislation to retrofit existing homes against wildfires have stalled over questions of funding .",
            "Other communities are coming up with their own creative solutions .",
            "In Boulder , Colorado , county officials worked with insurance companies on an incentive program set up after the Fourmile Canyon Fire in 2010 burned dozens of homes .",
            "Residents can have a specialist visit and identify steps to reduce fire risk , such as removing certain trees or cleaning dead leaves from gutters .",
            "Homeowners who comply have a better chance of getting insured .",
            "Experts also say both the federal government and states will need to rethink their approach to managing forests .",
            "For over a century , firefighting agencies have focused on extinguishing fires whenever they occur .",
            "That strategy has often proved counterproductive .",
            "Many landscapes evolved to burn periodically , and when fires are suppressed , vegetation builds up thickly in forests .",
            "So when fires do break out , they tend to be far more severe and destructive .",
            "The Forest Service has programs to thin out forests , removing smaller trees and brush .",
            "But those efforts remain relatively modest , and funding is a hurdle : The share of the Forest Service 's budget devoted to fighting fires has risen from 15 % to 55 % in recent years , leaving less money to prevent fires in the first place .",
            "And forest-thinning programs can be poorly targeted , researchers have found , as they often support logging efforts , rather than effectively reducing fire risk .",
            "Scientists who study wildfires agree that allowing forests and grasslands to burn periodically -- by , say , intentionally setting smaller fires under controlled conditions -- can be a more effective way to clear out vegetation .",
            "In Ponderosa pine forests , for instance , low-level fire can nurture ecosystems and help prevent destructive large-scale fires from breaking out .",
            "This already occurs in the southeastern United States , where officials use prescribed fires to burn millions of acres each year .",
            "While the region still sees destructive blazes -- like Tennessee 's drought-fueled Great Smoky Mountains fires in 2016 , which killed at least 14 people -- experts credit the use of controlled burns with sparing many southeastern communities from fire damage .",
            "`` Today fire is widely accepted as a tool for land management in the Southeast , '' said Crystal Kolden , a fire scientist at the University of California , Merced .",
            "With rare exceptions , however , the practice remains infrequent in the West .",
            "California intentionally burned just 50,000 acres in 2017 .",
            "In August , Gov.",
            "Gavin Newsom signed a memorandum with the Forest Service and others recognizing that the state needs more preventive fire , saying `` California 's forests naturally adapted to low-intensity fire , nature 's preferred management tool . ''",
            "But the scale is daunting : One study found that the state would need to burn or treat 20 million acres to counteract the legacy of fire suppression .",
            "( Researchers have estimated that in prehistoric times , around 4-12 million acres in the state burned each year , but that has since dropped precipitously .",
            ") The obstacles to using fire this way are considerable : Fire agencies worry about intentional fires raging out of control , as happened in New Mexico in 2000 , when a prescribed burn caught by high winds ended up destroying 435 homes .",
            "And the smoke can be a concern for nearby communities .",
            "Using prescribed fire as a tool to manage forests will take concerted effort and a cultural shift in acceptance of fire , experts said .",
            "Kolden noted that many Indigenous communities have a long history of using fire to manage the landscape .",
            "`` We should be empowering the people who know how to do this , '' she said .",
            "Finally , there 's climate change .",
            "Much of the fire-prone American West is expected to become even warmer and drier in coming decades , said Park Williams , a climate scientist at Columbia University 's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory .",
            "In a paper last year , Williams and colleagues noted that the effects of climate change on California 's fires so far `` have arisen from what may someday be viewed as a relatively small amount of warming . ''",
            "The effects of climate change on wildfires is n't linear but exponential , he said , and the climate will respond slowly even to aggressive action to combat warming .",
            "Therefore , any lack of strong action on climate will yield far worse wildfires .",
            "`` Things could be bad , or really bad , by 2050 , '' he said .",

            "SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) -- A dense smoke layer from dozens of raging wildfires darkened the skies and fouled the air along much of the West Coast on Thursday and was expected to hover in the region at least through the weekend .",
            "Eerie orange and red skies across California , Oregon and Washington had mainly turned gray thanks to stronger winds coming in from the Pacific Ocean that helped to disperse thick smoke that acted as a filter scattering blue light and only allowing yellow , orange and red light to reach the ground .",
            "`` The wind has been blowing the smoke up more offshore so , the sun is not being blocked as much as it was yesterday , '' said Steve Anderson , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service 's Bay Area office .",
            "But as the wind scattered the smoke and a layer of air blocking it from reaching the ground started dissipating Thursday , smoke particles began mixing with ground-level air worsening air quality in much of California and parts of Oregon where wildfires are raging .",
            "Satellite photos Thursday showed a towering band of smoke hovering along the Pacific coast .",
            "In the San Francisco Bay Area , conditions were expected to linger at least through Friday when the Bay Area Air Quality Management District expects to issue its 25th consecutive Spare The Air alert requiring residents to cut pollution -- the longest stretch since the program began in 1991 .",
            "The alerts began Aug. 18 after thousands of lightning strikes ignited three massive wildfires to the north , south and east of San Francisco .",
            "Air quality warnings also were issued throughout the Pacific Northwest , and people in communities from southern Oregon to north of Seattle reported hazy skies and choking smoke .",
            "The smoke was still blocking out so much sunlight that a forecast for Bay Area temperatures to climb to 90 degrees ( 32 Celsius ) instead dipped to the 60s ( 15.5 Celsius ) .",
            "In Los Angeles , at least six COVID-19 testing sites closed Thursday and Friday due to smoky air brought on by two massive wildfires burning in Los Angeles National Forest and the San Bernardino Mountains .",
            "A respite from the bad air and a chance to see blue skies could come by the middle of next week when the forecast shows stronger winds and light rain , Anderson said .",
            "`` We 'll get more of an onshore flow , stronger winds , blowing the smoke out of our area but eastward into Nevada , Idaho , Utah , Colorado , '' Anderson said .",
            "The rain will not be enough to put out the fires but `` it 'll definitely be welcomed by the firefighting efforts , '' he said ."

            "And that 's more than a million acres higher than the previous one-year record .",
            "What might be more shocking is that more than 90 % of that area has burned in just the last three weeks .",
            "Five of the top 10 biggest fires in the state 's records , which go back about a century , have occurred during that period .",
            "And that 's since dry lightning storms swept the state in mid-August .",
            "Thousands of homes have burned .",
            "And at least 12 people have been killed here .",

            "BREKKE : Well , you know , it is .",
            "It 's hard to comprehend .",
            "But we 're talking about 5,000 square miles that have burned this year .",
            "So if you imagine a line running from near where you are in Boston down to Washington and on to Richmond , Va. , and everything in a 10-mile strip burning , that 's what we 're talking about .",
            "Or in California , from San Francisco to San Diego - that 's about the right ballpark to imagine the scale of destruction .",
            "PFEIFFER : Massive .",
            "And I understand these fires have n't only been big .",
            "They have other things in common .",
            "BREKKE : Well , just like we heard from Erin , the fires have been incredibly fast moving .",
            "There was a fire over the weekend in the Sierra Nevada , south of Yosemite , that moved so fast that helicopter rescues were needed to get more than 200 people out .",
            "On Tuesday night , crews near Paradise , which you mentioned at the top , were forced to rescue about a hundred people as high winds swept the north part of the state and blew a fire that had n't been a very big priority completely out of control .",
            "And that fire by itself burned about 200,000 acres in a little more than 24 hours .",
            "At a briefing last night , John Messina , who is a Cal Fire chief working on that fire , talked about the need to get people out of harm 's way as fires blow through the forest .",
            "( SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING ) JOHN MESSINA : Every single fire crew , bulldozer and fire engine becomes a premium resource .",
            "And we can not be using premium resources to assist in rescues for people who refuse to evacuate .",
            "PFEIFFER : The fire he 's talking about , the North Complex Fire , has been burning in Butte County , which has seen catastrophic fires before .",
            "What has the impact been there ?",
            "BREKKE : Well , that 's right .",
            "Back in November 2018 , a wildfire called the Camp Fire burned down the town of Paradise and a couple of nearby communities .",
            "Eighty-five people died , and about 14,000 homes were destroyed .",
            "And when red glows appeared across the hills yesterday , the mayor of Paradise , Greg Bolan , told me people were quite anxious .",
            "GREG BOLIN : You can hear in their voice , their questions .",
            "What 's going on ?",
            "Do I need to leave ?",
            "Or what do I need to do ?",
            "You know , it 's horrible over here , looks terrible .",
            "I see a red glow to the trees .",
            "Is there a fire in Paradise ?",
            "BREKKE : So the good news is that the winds have died down up there today .",
            "And the town looks like it 's safe for the time being .",
            "But there 's a reason for the anxiety people have up there .",
            "Cal Fire says its preliminary estimate is that about 2,000 structures in Butte County have been destroyed or damaged by this fire .",
            "And the sheriff announced last night that three people have died in the fire so far , and a dozen people had been reported as unaccounted for .",

            "There was a lower-than-average number of wildfires in 2020 despite hotspots such as California and Australia being hit by blazes of unprecedented intensity , the European Union 's satellite monitoring service said Monday .",
            "A year of data collected by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ( CAMS ) showed that carbon emissions from fires were set to be lower than previous years and that 2020 was one of the lowest years for active fires globally .",
            "Despite this , it said that the worst affected areas had experienced above average fire intensity , leading to roughly 1.7 billion tonnes of carbon pollution .",
            "This compares with 1.9 billion tonnes in 2019 .",
            "`` While 2020 has certainly been a devastating year for wildfires in the most badly-affected hotspots , emissions across the world have been lower due to better fire management and mitigation measures , '' said Mark Parrington , senior scientist and wildfire expert at CAMS .",
            "He said that globally fires had declined consistently since 2003 when the monitoring service began .",
            "`` However , this is no time to be complacent as wildfires in the worse affected areas were of record intensity as a result of warmer , drier conditions , '' Parrington added .",
            "`` This resulted in increased pollutants being carried thousands of miles , affecting air quality for millions of people . ''",
            "CAMS said four areas were especially hard hit .",
            "In the western United States , data showed some of the most severe wildfire regions on record following abnormally hot and dry weather in August and September .",
            "Smoke from fires in California , Oregon and Washington spread across the Atlantic Ocean as far as northern Europe -- releasing more than 30 megatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere .",
            "Fires in the Arctic beat all previous annual emissions records as early as September , with emissions in the first nine months of 2020 topping 244 megatonnes , compared with 181 megatonnes for all of 2019 .",
            "The Caribbean was also badly hit , with record fire emissions in Guatemala and above average emissions levels across the region .",
            "And in Australia , fires of record-breaking intensity released some 400 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere , with the blazes producing smoke clouds large enough to cover Russia , CAMS , said .",

            "BOISE , Idaho ( AP ) -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often they are used while crews fight wildfires .",
            "`` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday .",
            "`` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate . ''",
            "Still , the shelters have saved more than 300 firefighters since they began being used in the 1960s and became required in firefighting equipment in the late 1970s , Bilbao said .",
            "They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds ( 2 kilograms ) and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees ( 1,090 Celsius ) of heat for about a minute .",
            "The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure .",
            "The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said .",
            "The firefighters who used the shelters in a national forest near Big Sur along the central California coast suffered burns and smoke inhalation Tuesday , and three were flown to a hospital .",
            "They were all stable , with two in fair condition and one in critical condition , said Chris Barth , spokesman for the Dolan Fire .",
            "The group was trying to protect a fire station in rugged mountains in Los Padres National Forest , but Barth did n't immediately have more details about how they were overtaken by flames .",
            "Three firefighters near Bozeman , Montana , also had to deploy fire shelters last weekend .",
            "After the wildfire passed , they walked to safety , were taken to a hospital and have since been released .",
            "Fire shelters are occasionally redesigned to better withstand extreme conditions .",
            "At 500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 260 degrees Celsius ) , the glue that holds the protective layers together begins to melt .",
            "Crew members may have just seconds or minutes to find a safe spot to deploy the shelters , climb inside and manage to hold them tight to the ground despite the whipping gusts that often come with a wall of flames .",
            "The last attempt at a redesign came in 2013 , after 19 members of a 20-person hotshot crew from a Prescott , Arizona , fire department died despite using the shelters when a fire overtook them in some hills .",
            "Over the next several years , the U.S. Forest Service and other state , federal and local representatives worked with researchers to review hundreds of different materials .",
            "Researchers came up with four prototypes that were tested in the field in 2018 , two intended to be used by firefighters who work on the fire lines and two intended for firefighters who operate big equipment .",
            "Some performed slightly better than the shelter used now but were ultimately rejected after failing production requirements or because they were heavier and bulkier .",
            "Officials decided to stay with the current shelter , in part because of a decreasing trend in how often they were used .",
            "They also noted that none of the options could do the impossible .",
            "`` Regardless of size or weight , the research indicates that none of the prototypes would ensure firefighter survival in extreme fire conditions , '' Dave Haston , chairman of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group 's equipment technology committee wrote in a March 2019 memo .",
            "The current shelter was developed after the deaths of 14 firefighters who were overrun by flames on a Colorado mountain in 1994 .",
            "The Colorado and Arizona disasters are among the deadliest for wildland firefighters since fire shelters became mandatory equipment in 1977 .",

            "BOISE , Idaho ( AP ) -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often they are used in wildfires .",
            "`` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday .",
            "`` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate . ''",
            "Still , the shelters have saved more than 300 firefighters since they began being used in the 1960s and became required in firefighting equipment in the late 1970s , Bilbao said .",
            "They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds ( 2 kilograms ) and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees ( 1,090 Celsius ) of heat for about a minute .",
            "The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure .",
            "The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said .",
            "The firefighters who used the shelters in a national forest near Big Sur along the central California coast suffered burns and smoke inhalation Tuesday .",
            "Three were flown to a hospital , two in fair condition and one in critical .",
            "All are expected to recover and return to work , Los Padres National Forest spokesman Andrew Madsen said Wednesday .",
            "Some firefighters were coming off the night shift and another crew was preparing to go out for the day when the wind-whipped blaze that had nearly doubled in size overnight came over a hill .",
            "The firefighters tried to protect their fire station , but the flames overwhelmed them , and they deployed their shelters , Madsen said .",
            "`` It 's a really harrowing experience for those who go through a close encounter like that and we 're very grateful that the injuries are such that all three who were hospitalized are going to recover , '' he said .",
            "Two of the firefighters were expected to be released from the hospital soon , Madsen said , and the third by the end of the week .",
            "The other 11 are taking time off and talking to specialists to process their experience , he said .",
            "The station and the firefighters ' belongings were all destroyed .",
            "Three firefighters near Bozeman , Montana , also had to deploy fire shelters last weekend .",
            "After the wildfire passed , they walked to safety , were taken to a hospital and have since been released .",
            "Fire shelters are occasionally redesigned to better withstand extreme conditions .",
            "At 500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 260 degrees Celsius ) , the glue that holds the protective layers together begins to melt .",
            "Crew members may have just seconds or minutes to find a safe spot to deploy the shelters , climb inside and manage to hold them tight to the ground despite the whipping gusts that often come with a wall of flames .",
            "The last attempt at a redesign came in 2013 , after 19 members of a 20-person hotshot crew from a Prescott , Arizona , fire department died despite using the shelters when a fire overtook them .",
            "Over the next several years , the U.S. Forest Service and other state , federal and local representatives worked with researchers to review hundreds of different materials .",
            "Researchers came up with four prototypes that were tested in the field in 2018 , two intended to be used by firefighters who work on the fire lines and two intended for firefighters who operate big equipment .",
            "Some performed slightly better than the shelter used now but were ultimately rejected after failing production requirements or because they were heavier and bulkier .",
            "Officials decided to stay with the current shelter , in part because of a decreasing trend in how often they were used .",
            "They also noted that none of the options could do the impossible .",
            "`` Regardless of size or weight , the research indicates that none of the prototypes would ensure firefighter survival in extreme fire conditions , '' Dave Haston , chairman of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group 's equipment technology committee wrote in a March 2019 memo .",
            "The current shelter was developed after the deaths of 14 firefighters who were overrun by flames on a Colorado mountain in 1994 .",
            "The Colorado and Arizona disasters are among the deadliest for wildland firefighters since fire shelters became mandatory equipment in 1977 .",

            "People from San Francisco to Seattle woke Wednesday to hazy clouds of smoke lingering in the air , darkening the sky to an eerie orange glow that kept street lights illuminated into midday , all thanks to dozens of wildfires throughout the West .",
            "`` It 's after 9 a.m. and there 's still no sign of the sun , '' the California Highway Patrol 's Golden Gate division tweeted , urging drivers to turn on their headlights and slow down .",
            "Social media was filled with photos of the unusual sky and many people complained their cellphone cameras were n't accurately capturing the golden hues .",
            "Despite the foreboding skies , there was little scent of smoke and the air quality index did not reach unhealthy levels .",
            "That 's because fog drifting from the Pacific Ocean was sandwiched between the smoke and surface .",
            "Meanwhile , smoke particles above the marine layer were only allowing yellow-orange-red light to reach the surface , said Ralph Borrmann , a spokesman for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District .",
            "He said conditions were expected to remain until Friday ; by then the district expects to issue its 25th consecutive Spare The Air alert requiring residents to cut pollution -- the longest stretch since the program began in 1991 .",
            "The previous streak was a 14-day alert issued in 2018 when the Bay Area was choked by smoke from a fire that devastated the town of Paradise and killed 85 people .",
            "This time , strong winds from the north and northeast pushed smoke from devastating wildfires in Oregon and Washington state into lower elevations , said Roger Gass , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Bay Area .",

            "The power was proactively cut Monday in an effort to prevent power line-sparked wildfires .",
            "Air quality warnings were issued throughout the Pacific Northwest , and people in communities from southern Oregon to north of Seattle have seen blood red skies and choking smoke .",
            "`` It was scary .",
            "Especially as red as the sky was , '' said Patricia Fouts , who evacuated from a senior living center due to a massive fire east of Salem , Oregon .",
            "Gass said winds coming from the Pacific Ocean will likely continue to push the smoke across the West , worsening air quality .",

            "The haze from fires across the West , including a blaze in western Colorado that is the largest in state history , led Colorado 's state health department to issue an air quality alert on Labor Day .",

            "SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) -- California , which has endured its worst wildfire season in history , is bracing for the most dangerous winds of the year , a forecast that prompted the largest utility to announce plans to cut power Sunday to nearly 1 million people to guard against its equipment sparking new blazes .",
            "Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said the outages would start in far Northern California and ultimately could affect 386,000 customers in 38 counties , with many of the shutoffs concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area .",
            "At a Saturday night briefing , utility officials said high winds were expected to arrive midday Sunday and reach 40 to 60 mph ( 64 to 97 kph ) with higher gusts in the mountains .",
            "Winds that strong can topple trees and send branches into power lines .",
            "Some of the largest and deadliest fires in recent years were started by utility equipment being damaged by high winds , so PG&E has been aggressive about pre-emptively cutting power when fire conditions are most dangerous .",
            "This will be the fifth time PG&E has cut power to customers this year and by far the largest shutdown .",
            "`` We obviously recognize that power outages present hardships .",
            "That 's why we try to make it as small as we can , '' PG&E incident commander Mark Quinlan said , noting that the planned shutdown had been reduced from 466,000 customers .",
            "Cities throughout the region planned to open emergency operations centers and add police officers and firefighters to patrol high-risk areas .",
            "Officials also were encouraging people to have their cellphones fully charged or , if they have a landline , to connect an older model phone that does n't depend on electricity .",
            "In Berkeley , just east of San Francisco , officials recommended residents consider leaving the hills before Sunday afternoon , especially if they would have trouble getting out quickly during a fire .",
            "In neighboring Oakland , where a blaze in the city 's hills in October 1991 killed 25 people , at least 10 parks will close Sunday and Monday .",
            "`` I would ask all of the people who live in high-impact areas mimic us and plan ahead of time and do the planning with their neighbors , with their families and within their own households so that if they are asked to evacuate they 're ready and not just then starting to figure it out , '' Oakland Assistant Fire Chief Robert Lipp said .",
            "While about one-third of the affected customers will be in the Bay Area , cuts are predicted to encompass parts of the Sacramento Valley , the northern and central Sierra Nevada , the Santa Cruz Mountains , the Central Coast and parts of southern Kern County .",
            "The projected shutoffs included 19,000 customers in parts of Butte County , where in November 2018 a blaze ignited by PG&E equipment destroyed much of the town of Paradise and killed 85 people , the most in state history .",

            "There have been 31 deaths .",

            "All of the largest fires have been fully or significantly contained .",
            "But more than 6,000 firefighters remain committed to 19 blazes , including a dozen major incidents , according to state fire officials Almost all of Northern California is in moderate to extreme drought .",
            "The combination of high winds , very low humidity and a parched landscape has the region on edge .",
            "The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for many areas , meaning fire danger is extremely high .",
            "It said the conditions could equal those during devastating fires in the Bay Area 's wine country in 2017 and last year 's Kincade Fire that burned a large swath of Sonoma County .",
            "Fire officials said PG&E transmission lines sparked the Kincade Fire last October , which destroyed hundreds of homes and caused nearly 100,000 people to flee .",
            "`` Given that vegetation is now at or near record dryness levels -- much as it was prior to the North Bay firestorm in October 2017 -- this is a very concerning forecast , '' Daniel Swain , climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research , wrote in a blog post .",

            "But in the previous outage , the PG&E brought in temporary generators to provide electricity .",
            "`` The generators are are still set up out there , so I 'm hoping they 're going to keep our power up , '' Collins said .",
            "She said losing power is becoming a common occurrence , and people are having to live without electricity for days at time .",

            "The California power grid operator is asking residents to conserve energy this weekend , with a brutal heat wave projected to bring an increase in electricity demand while people try to stay cool .",
            "Temperatures in Brentwood and Gilroy could hit 112 degrees on Sunday , projected to be the hottest day in many areas , and 113 degrees in Napa and Livermore .",
            "The California Independent System Operator issued the statewide Flex Alert , which calls for voluntary electricity conservation , beginning Saturday and extending through Monday , from 3 to 9 p.m each day .",
            "Flex Alerts are issued when the power grid is under stress .",
            "They are part of the effort to avoid rolling blackouts , such as those that occurred during the heat wave last month , when the grid was overtaxed by air conditioners .",
            "Temperatures are expected to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal throughout California over Labor Day weekend , according to the grid operator .",
            "Overnight temperatures are also expected to be 10 degrees above normal , which makes it hard for homes and other facilities to cool down naturally .",
            "The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat watch for the weekend .",
            "`` It will be uncomfortable , but not as bad as Labor Day weekend three years ago , '' said weather service meteorologist Gerry Diaz .",
            "He was referring to the 2017 heat spell that sent San Francisco thermometers rocketing to 106 degrees -- an all-time high .",
            "San Francisco could see a high of 90 degrees on Sunday .",
            "The heat wave this weekend is not expected to be as problematic for the power grid as the one in mid-August , either , California officials said .",
            "As of now , rolling blackouts are not expected , but residents should still conserve energy in case of unforeseen demand or unexpected damage to the grid -- especially as the fires still burning in California bring another layer of uncertainty .",
            "`` The more cushion we have between where we need to be , the better , and conservation helps us with that , '' said Eric Schmitt , vice president of operations for the California ISO .",
            "Pacific Gas and Electric Co. urged its customers to follow the Flex Alert and reduce energy to `` help make sure the state has enough supply to meet demand for electricity . ''",
            "Bringing more energy into Califormia from other states in the West may be easier than it was in August , because the heat wave will not be as widespread .",
            "`` There may be more resources that are outside of California that could be used in Calfornia , '' Schmitt said .",
            "This time around , the grid operator plans to have state agencies help with communicating with businesses and consumers about conservation measures , which Schmitt said was very successful during the August heat wave .",
            "Officials said that the stress on the grid tends to hit a high point when solar production stops , but emphasized that this does not indicate that California is over-reliant on renewable energy .",
            "Rather , it 's part of the transition pains in moving toward a clean , carbon-free power grid , they said .",
            "Better ways to store solar power and using other energy options , like geothermal , can help alleviate that , said Mark Rothleder , vice president of market policy and performance for California ISO .",
            "`` We need to have a diverse mix of resources that can meet the demand in all hours , '' he said .",
            "`` I think we can do that and still drive towards a high-renewable , low-carbon grid , but we have to be more thoughtful and maybe more aggressive about ensuring that we build that capacity and that capability . ''",
            "The power grid operator issued another order for Saturday and Sunday to facilities that help supply power .",
            "It requires power generators and transmission operators to postpone any planned outages for routine maintenance , to ensure as much power is available as possible .",
            "The latest heat wave arrives as firefighters struggle to contain three historic wildfires that have scorched hundreds of thousands of acres across the Bay Area and choked the skies with smoke .",
            "Air quality reached unhealthy levels in San Francisco , Oakland and Berkeley on Thursday .",
            "Meteorologists are not predicting another round of lightning this weekend , Diaz said , but the excess heat is expected to trap particles emitted from the wildfires , cloaking the Bay Area in a thick layer of smoke .",
            "`` Think about it like a dome .",
            "This hot air mass over our area is keeping the heat and smoke trapped near the surface , without much air flow , '' Diaz said .",
            "This smoke can also affect solar power , Rothleder said , as it comes between the sun and solar panels .",
            "`` We do see some reduction in the solar production as a result of that smoke , '' he said .",
            "How much depends on how widespread the smoke is , if it 's combined with cloud cover , and what the smoke level is during the day , when solar production is highest .",
            "Power grid operator officials pointed out that this month is still summer for much of California , so there could be more Flex Alerts and high demand days still to come .",
            "`` Until we clear September , we could have other tight , demanding , days , '' Schmitt said .",

            "SALT LAKE CITY -- A new online wildfire dashboard released last week now provides Utahns a better look not only at the fires currently burning in the state but also trends of previously reported wildfires -- and that 's quite a lot of information to take in this year .",
            "State and federal officials report there had been 1,224 wildfire starts , as of 9 a.m. Thursday .",
            "The fires have collectively burned over 200,000 acres of land across the state , according to information provided by the Utah Wildfire Dashboard , which was publicly launched on Aug. 27 .",
            "The website says it was designed as a way to `` show real-time fire information and aggregate data . ''",
            "The Bureau of Land Management , U.S. Forest Service , Utah Department of Natural Resources and its Division of Forestry , Fire and State Lands -- the agencies that comprise most of the state and federal agencies that fight wildfires in the state and run Utah Fire Info -- oversee the dashboard .",
            "It was originally developed in July as an internal tool to provide state and federal fire officials with a better look at trends seen in fire data , said Julie Osterkamp , fire geospace ecologist for the Bureau of Land Management 's Utah office and designer of the dashboard .",
            "But government officials quickly decided to release it to the public as an informative look at the fire season .",
            "`` All of our systems over the past three to five years have really started to integrate more , and we have better and better access to data , '' Osterkamp said .",
            "`` It used to be all file systems and whatnot , but now that everything is being published in the cloud and people are given certain permissions -- it 's there , but now we 're just starting to utilize it and present it so other folks can consume it . ''",
            "Unlike Utah Fire Info 's original map showcasing current active large wildfires , the Utah Wildfire Dashboard shows location and acreage information of all current fires and all previous 2020 fires , regardless of the size or duration of the fire .",
            "So , you can see where a 1-acre human-caused fire happened near Beck Street in Salt Lake City on Aug. 22 or where the 78,000-acre Canal Fire in Millard County started .",
            "The map updates after a new fire is called in , as well .",
            "For example , there were two new fires within 24 hours of 9 a.m. Thursday that burned 41 acres in Utah .",
            "In addition , the map lists seven active large fires currently burning .",
            "False alarms , abandoned campfires and smoke reports are not listed on the site .",
            "The fires that are logged in are broken down into three categories : human-caused , natural-caused and unknown , which are indicated in red , yellow and blue , respectively .",
            "This allows the viewer a quick look at where human-caused and naturally-caused fires are occurring .",
            "The website even breaks down the number of fires by county and provides acreage and cause information regarding the 25 largest wildfires of the year .",
            "So what does this website tell us about Utah 's current fire situation ?",
            "Most fires this year have been human-caused Human causes , such as leaving a campfire unattended or from the spark of a vehicle , are by far the primary reason for wildfires in Utah .",
            "This is something we 've heard from fire officials already .",
            "State and federal agencies report 816 fires have already been determined to be human-caused with another 101 unknown .",
            "Only 307 fires are believed to be natural , such as those caused by lightning .",
            "Some of these figures are different from what the Forestry , Fire and State Lands released on Wednesday .",
            "Both have similar wildfire start totals , but the two agencies have different percentages for human-caused fires .",
            "For example , the state reports 905 of 1,210 fires as of Sunday were human-caused , which is about 75 % .",
            "The Utah Wildfire Dashboard lists 66 % of fires as human-caused -- although , adding the number of fires listed as unknown leads to 75 % .",
            "Jason Curry , a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Forestry , Fire and State Lands , explained it 's due to a difference in information at the time a fire is logged into the dashboard .",
            "The dashboard data shown reflects the initial report to a call center ; it has n't been updated to reflect that almost all of the fires listed as unknown were human-caused , he said .",
            "This lag happens because the cause of a fire was n't known at the time it was called in , and it may take days for investigators to determine a cause .",
            "Osterkamp added she hopes the data provided from both the dashboard and fire officials will eventually be unified to avoid potential confusion from information released by agencies .",
            "No region is spared from wildfires The data shows regions do n't dictate wildfires -- they 're literally everywhere .",
            "Just look at the top five counties where wildfires have been reported : Washington County in southwestern Utah leads with 128 fire starts , followed by Uintah County in northeastern Utah with 118 fires .",
            "Tooele ( 93 fires ) in northwestern Utah , Millard ( 87 fires ) in central Utah , and Iron ( 73 fires ) in southwestern Utah round out the counties with the most fires .",
            "Duchesne , Summit , San Juan , Utah and Sevier counties have at least 50 fire starts this year .",
            "At least one fire has been reported in every county this year , too .",
            "Piute County in southern Utah has the fewest with four fires .",
            "Wayne , Rich , Carbon and Davis counties round out the top five in fewest fires .",
            "Daggett , Cache , Morgan , Salt Lake and Emery counties all have had fewer than 20 fire starts reported .",
            "Natural-caused fires have burned more acres on average It does n't matter what sparks a fire , natural and human causes have been equally destructive in terms of fire size this year .",
            "The two largest fires so far , the 78.065-acre Canal Fire and the 20,941-acre Rock Path Fire , were caused by lightning .",
            "The human-caused Knolls ( 12,584 acres ) , Turkey Farm Road ( 11,993 acres ) and Tabby Canyon ( 6,849 acres ) rounded out the top five .",
            "In fact , of the Top 25 fires by size , there was n't really a difference by cause .",
            "Fourteen were human-caused , 10 were natural-caused , and one was listed as unknown .",
            "But since there are significantly more human-caused fires , natural-caused wildfires are larger on average .",
            "The average natural-caused blaze was about 436 acres , as of Thursday morning .",
            "The average size for human-caused fires was about 81 acres , or close to 76 acres if you lump all unknown caused fires into that category .",
            "It should be noted that while human-caused fires are smaller in average size , it still requires resources to contain or put out a fire that otherwise would not have been used , and that can cause a strain on firefighting services .",
            "Human activity leaves interesting fire patterns One quirk within the red dots is the patterns one can find with them .",
            "For example , a user can see a trail of dots along the path of I-15 as the freeway cuts through the state .",
            "Similar patterns follow the routes of different freeways and highways in the state .",
            "Utah fire officials have noted for some time how sparks from vehicles or a flat fire can cause a fire .",
            "`` Obviously , human-caused fires are usually where humans live ; but they 're also pretty concentrated around major corridors like I-15 and I-70 , and to like I-80 in Tooele County , '' Osterkamp said .",
            "`` When you zoom in , it almost looks like the dots are just following the road . ''",
            "It 's not just roads .",
            "Popular camping and recreation areas are also located in areas where the red dots are bunched .",
            "Much like roads , it 's not surprising because that 's where people are , and they may be doing activities that can spark fires , like target shooting or misusing ATVs on public land .",
            "Osterkamp sees the dashboard as an advantage for people heading out for recreational activities to curb wildfires .",
            "If you plan to go somewhere and participate in an activity that could spark a fire and see it 's in an area surrounded by red dots , it 's likely an indication that the fire risk is strong for that location .",
            "That 's the hope fire and land officials have from the dashboard , especially during an active fire season .",
            "They hope the data will lead to a better understanding of the situation firefighters currently face so people will make better decisions outside .",
            "`` It 's really cool to be able to see exactly where the human starts are and how many we have had this year , '' Osterkamp said , referring to the dashboard data .",
            "`` If they see that this ( certain ) area had a ton of human starts recently , I would hope that would register . ''"

            "Silvera , a 43-year-old battalion chief with Cal Fire , California 's state firefighting agency , said he 's lost track of the blazes he 's fought this year .",
            "He and his crew have sometimes been on duty for 64 hours at a stretch , their only rest coming in 20-minute catnaps .",
            "`` I 've been at this 23 years , and by far this is the worst I 've seen , '' Silvera said before bunking down at a motel for 24 hours .",
            "After working in Santa Cruz County , his next assignment was to head north to attack wildfires near the Oregon border .",
            "His exhaustion reflects the situation on the West Coast fire lines : This year 's blazes have taxed the human , mechanical and financial resources of the nation 's wildfire-fighting forces to an extraordinary degree .",
            "And half of the fire season is yet to come .",
            "Heat , drought and a strategic decision to attack the flames early combined with the coronavirus to put a historically heavy burden on fire teams .",
            "`` There 's never enough resources , '' said Silvera , one of nearly 17,000 firefighters battling the California blazes .",
            "`` Typically with Cal Fire , we 're able to attack -- air tankers , choppers , dozers .",
            "We 're good at doing that .",

            "Agencies are constantly seeking firefighters , aircraft , engines and support personnel .",
            "Fire crews have been summoned from at least nine states and other countries , including Canada and Israel .",
            "Hundreds of agreements for agencies to offer mutual assistance have been maxed out at the federal , state and local levels , he said .",
            "`` We know that there 's really nothing left in the bucket , '' Geissler said .",
            "`` Our sister agencies to the south in California and Oregon are really struggling . ''",
            "Demand for firefighting resources has been high since mid-August , when fire officials bumped the national preparedness level to critical , meaning at least 80 % of crews were already committed to fighting fires , and there were few personnel and little equipment to spare .",
            "Because of the extreme fire behavior , `` you ca n't say for sure having more resources would make a difference , '' said Carrie Bilbao , a spokesperson for the National Interagency Fire Center .",
            "Officials at the U.S. government operation in Boise , Idaho help decide which fires get priority when equipment and firefighters run scarce nationwide .",
            "Government spending on fighting wildfires has more than tripled since the 1990s , to an average of $ 1.8 billion annually .",
            "That 's failed to reduce the problem as climate change , drought and millions of trees killed by pests led to more fires in the Western U.S. over the same period , particularly dangerous `` megafires '' that burn 100,000 acres or more .",
            "The growing severity has spurred federal lawmakers to push prevention efforts , including controlled burns , faster approval of logging projects and upgrading homes to make them more fire resistant .",

            "People are dying .",
            "The smoke is literally starting to cover our country , and our way of life as we know it is in danger , '' Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana said Wednesday during testimony in support of an emergency wildfire bill , co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California , that would direct more resources to prevention .",
            "Andy Stahl , a forester who runs Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics , an advocacy group in Oregon , said it would have been impossible to stop some of the most destructive blazes , a task he compared to `` dropping a bucket of water on an atomic bomb . ''",
            "Yet Stahl contends the damage could have been less if government agencies were not so keen to put out every blaze .",
            "Extinguishing smaller fires and those that ignite during wetter months allows fuel to build up , setting the stage for bigger fires during times of drought and hot , windy weather , he said .",
            "That 's been exacerbated this year by the pandemic , which led U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen to issue a directive in June to fight all fires aggressively , reversing a decadeslong trend of allowing some to burn .",
            "The idea was to minimize large concentrations of firefighters by extinguishing blazes quickly .",
            "Fighting the flames from the air was key to the strategy , with 35 air tankers and 200 helicopters used , Forest Service spokesperson Kaari Carpenter said .",
            "Yet by Aug. 30 , following the deaths of firefighters , including four aviators , fire officials in Boise warned that long-term fatigue was setting in .",
            "They called for a `` tactical pause '' to reinforce safe practices .",
            "With no end in sight to the pandemic , some worry the focus on aggressively attacking every fire could last .",
            "Allowing instead for more fires to burn if they are not threatening life or property would free up firefighters for the most dangerous blazes , said Tim Ingalsbee with the advocacy group Firefighters United for Safety , Ethics and Ecology .",
            "Cal Fire 's roughly 8,000 personnel have been fighting blazes from the Oregon border to the Mexico border , bouncing from fire to fire , said Tim Edwards , president of the union for Cal Fire , the nation 's second largest firefighting agency .",
            "`` We 're battle-hardened , but it seems year after year , it gets tougher , and at some point in time , we wo n't be able to cope .",
            "We 'll reach a breaking point , '' said Edwards , a 25-year veteran .",
            "The immediate dangers are compounded by worries about COVID-19 in camp and at home .",
            "Firefighters `` see all this destruction and the fatigue , and then they 're getting those calls from home , where their families are dealing with school and child care because of COVID .",
            "It 's stressing them out , and we have to keep their heads in the game , '' he said .",
            "The pandemic also has limited the state 's use of inmate fire crews -- either because of early releases to prevent outbreaks in prisons or because many are under quarantine in those prisons , officials said .",
            "Aside from the human toll , the conflagrations in Colorado , Montana , Utah , New Mexico , Arizona , and now California and the Pacific Northwest have cost hundreds of millions of dollars .",
            "California alone has spent $ 529 million since July 1 on wildfires , said Daniel Berlant , assistant deputy director of Cal Fire .",
            "By comparison , the state spent $ 691 million the entire fiscal year that ended June 30 .",
            "The U.S. government will reimburse most state costs for the biggest disasters .",
            "Back in the field , Silvera and his crew saved two people at the beginning of their 26-day tour .",
            "Two hikers encountered the crew after the firefighters themselves were briefly trapped while trying to save the headquarters building at Big Basin Redwoods State Park .",
            "`` We got in a bad spot , and there were a few hours there we did n't know if we 'd make it , '' Silvera said .",

            "The Bobcat Fire was advancing at a mile or two an hour at times and continued to threaten the Mojave Desert town of Pearblossom after burning into the Antelope Valley foothill area , on the other side of the San Gabriel Mountains from Los Angeles .",
            "The blaze that began Sept. 6 destroyed or damaged at least 29 homes and other buildings , including some in the Juniper Hills area , with the toll rising to perhaps 85 when damage assessment teams can complete their work this week , authorities said .",

            "Lots of people in politics and the media out here in California are blaming global warming for the 26 major wildfires that have killed at least 24 , burned more than 3 million acres and destroyed thousands of homes .",
            "But let 's get real .",
            "This state has been plagued by wildfires long before baby left-wingers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decided that they 're caused by humans heating up the planet by burning fossil fuels .",
            "I grew up in Los Angeles in the 1950s .",
            "We did n't have as many people , cars or smokestacks in those days , but we had plenty of 115-degree days in the summer .",
            "Why ?",
            "Mainly because we were living in a desert .",
            "The L.A. area may not actually meet the official definition of a desert , but anyone who 's lived here long enough to get a suntan knows that 's essentially what it is .",
            "If it were n't for the Colorado River , which provides 1.4 trillion gallons of water a year to about 18 million Southern Californians , we could n't survive here .",
            "Because we live in a basin , and because temperature inversions in the atmosphere form caps that trap smoke and pollution , we 've always had smoke or smog hanging over us .",
            "Heck , when the Spaniards arrived by ship in the 1500s they saw the smoke over Los Angeles and called the harbor Baya de los Fumos , or Bay of the Smoke .",
            "The Spaniards did n't know whether the smoke came from the campfires in the many Native American villages in the basin or from the wildfires in the hills that had been started naturally by dry lightning -- just as they are today .",
            "When I was growing up , we had wildfires in the hills and the Santa Ana winds fanning them every year .",
            "It 's one of California 's seasons .",
            "It 's like Florida 's `` Hurricane Season , '' only we call it `` Fire Season . ''",
            "Back in the 1950s , the wildfires up and down the state mainly burned dry brush , grass and dead foliage , not homes and small towns .",
            "But in the last 70 years , as California 's population exploded , we 've built hundreds of thousands of new houses where they should n't be .",
            "Today wildfires still happen in the same places they used to , but the difference now is that hundreds of homes get destroyed .",
            "If you 're living in a rural or suburban area with a million dead trees around you and a wildfire starts from dry lightning , a downed PG&E power line or an arsonist , do n't be an AOC and blame global warming .",
            "Blame government stupidity .",
            "For a hundred years federal and state forest managers have practiced a wrong-headed policy that quickly suppresses wildfires .",
            "That policy , which has been criticized for decades , allows enormous amounts of fuel to build up on the forest or canyon floor so that when future wildfires start , as they will eventually , they will burn so fiercely they ca n't be stopped .",
            "Other bad government policies have helped to make wildfires more dangerous and destructive .",
            "They include allowing housing developments in high risk areas and environmental laws that prevent people from clearing the brush and trees around their homes .",
            "The state of California 's FAIR Plan that provides last-resort fire insurance to homes built in high-risk areas does n't help , either .",
            "AOC , Bernie Sanders , Kamala Harris and their frontman Joe Biden promise if they depose Donald Trump on Nov. 3 they 're going to pass the Green New Deal , rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement , save the planet and bring an end to things like California wildfires .",
            "But there 's a question the greenies never want us to ask : If we do everything you want us to do to cool down the planet , how much cooler will it be in 20 or 30 years ?",
            "The answer is something like .002 percent .",
            "Despite their big promises , even if we eliminate all cars and all fossil fuels and start living in caves again , LA 's future will still include 113-degree days , smog , droughts and killer wildfires .",
            "So reversing global warming is not going to stop California 's fire season , just as electing Joe Biden wo n't cure COVID-19 .",

            "By early Monday morning , forecasters had canceled a red flag warning for dry lightning and dangerous winds that threatened to spark new blazes and further hamper the battle against the massive fires .",
            "`` The threat of lightning and gusty and erratic winds that accompany thunderstorms have passed , so that is going to be good news for the firefighters out there , '' said meteorologist Cindy Palmer .",
            "Chris Bridger , a spokesperson for CalFire at the LNU complex base in Calistoga , said the `` weather was in our favor yesterday . ''",
            "The thunderstorms and lightning that did occur on Sunday hit sort of north and south around the fire but did n't affect this complex much , allowing the crews to make good progress overnight .",
            "`` It 's still dry , '' Bridger added , but `` we 're trying to take advantage of the weather conditions . ''",

            "At least seven people were killed in the growing crisis , including a fifth person who authorities confirmed Monday died in the Hennessey Fire in Solano County .",

            "`` Foundationally and fundamentally , we 're deploying every resource at our disposal , every resource that we have within the state , and you 'll see in a moment , some of the resources we 've pulled out of state into California to battle these historic wildfires , '' Newsom said Monday .",
            "The LNU Lightning Complex fires -- burning across Napa , Sonoma , Lake , Yolo and Solano counties -- received some good news Sunday night in the form of a small amount of rain .",
            "It likely was n't enough to douse any flames , but even a minimal amount of rain increases the humidity in the air , which can make fuel harder to burn .",

            "With several hundred more firefighters having arrived in the past few days , bringing the number to 1,511 , crews on the ground were able to take a more aggressive approach against the CZU Complex blaze , proactively protecting houses , according to San Mateo Consolidated Fire Department Battalion Chief Joe Novelli .",
            "The crews ' primary goal is to keep the blaze away from the town and the villages to the south in the San Lorenzo Valley and make sure it does n't jump Highway 9 , Novelli said .",

            "After record-breaking wildfires this year , thousands of people across the West are still clearing piles of charred debris where their homes once stood in the hope of rebuilding their lives .",
            "With climate change fueling bigger , more destructive wildfires , rebuilding offers an opportunity to create more fire-resistant communities by using building materials that can help homes survive the next blaze .",
            "But most states do n't require rebuilding with fire-resistant materials , an NPR analysis has found .",
            "While California has mandated wildfire building codes for more than a decade in high risk areas , other states have struggled to approve comprehensive rebuilding codes .",
            "In Oregon and Colorado , efforts faced stiff and ultimately successful opposition from home builders associations .",
            "Now , despite recent megafires , most property owners in Western states are not required to use materials like fire-resistant roofing or siding when they rebuild , which could slow the spread of wildfires or stop a house from igniting in the first place .",
            "As a result , current homeowners and hundreds of thousands new ones who move into risky areas could be left vulnerable to homelessness or harm while the risk of wildfire , driven by climate change , continues to mount .",
            "`` It does feel very much like a missed opportunity when it 's right there , '' says Daniel Gorham , a research engineer with the Insurance Institute for Building and Home Safety , a nonprofit research group funded by the insurance industry .",
            "`` We 're right there with the opportunity to build back stronger . ''",
            "Wildfire detectives It 's one of the most maddening things for people who live through wildfires : one home is completely burned to the ground , while next door , the house is still standing , untouched .",
            "In October , fire experts combed through a destroyed neighborhood in Santa Rosa , Calif. looking for explanations .",
            "Two weeks earlier , the Glass Fire swept through at jaw-dropping speed , driven by high winds and hot weather .",
            "`` We use these little clues , little things we can read , '' says Gorham , who studies how structures burn .",
            "Among the mounds of blackened debris , his team looked for surviving homes with burn marks that might give clues about the fire 's behavior .",
            "The holy grail is finding a trampoline .",
            "`` A trampoline is a really good thing for understanding the size of the embers that land , '' he says .",
            "As long as the trampoline does n't get destroyed , the charred spots across its surface hold a record of what the wind was carrying .",
            "Embers are one of the most potent ways a wildfire spreads .",
            "The tiny , glowing cinders can be blown miles ahead of the fire itself , igniting roofs , trees or anything else they land on .",
            "At one home , Gorham could see where an ember had ignited the mulch in the yard , burning all the way to the house 's deck .",
            "But the deck was made of fire-resistant materials and did n't ignite , sparing the rest of the house .",
            "`` It 's really important that we design and build structures to resist ember exposures , '' Gorham says .",
            "`` What you do to the roof , what you do in that immediate five-foot zone around the home and underneath the decks is critically important . ''",
            "For more than a decade , California has mandated special building codes for new homes built in risky fire zones , known as `` wildland-urban interface codes . ''",
            "They specify that roofs , siding and windows must be fire-resistant .",
            "Even minor aspects of a house are important , like covering attic vents with fine mesh , which can prevent embers from being blown into the house .",
            "Almost every home destroyed in California this year will need to meet the wildfire codes if rebuilt .",
            "The codes are no guarantee , because extreme fires can consume any kind of structure .",
            "But they greatly improve the odds .",
            "`` These building codes for wildfire-resistant construction do make a difference , '' Gorham says .",
            "`` We know that .",
            "We see that in the lab and we see that in the field . ''",
            "But in other Western states , adopting similar codes has hit roadblocks .",
            "Oregon argues for codes In Oregon , fire chiefs and officials began pushing for wildfire building codes two years ago .",
            "The decision fell to Oregon 's Residential and Manufactured Structures Board , a 11-member committee that reviews state building codes .",
            "With temperatures warming due to climate change , Oregon 's normally damp forests and woodlands have been drier during the summer , priming them for more extreme fires .",
            "Fire officials like Ralph Sartain of Ashland Fire and Rescue thought it was only a matter of time before Oregon saw the destructive fires that had already plagued California .",
            "`` We 're pushing further and further into the mountains but we 're not doing anything to protect the buildings , '' Sartain testified at the board 's hearing .",
            "Other voices joined in support .",
            "But the home construction industry pushed back .",
            "`` I think it 's unnecessary , '' board chair and home builder Janet Lewis responded .",
            "`` I think it 's time to allow Oregonians the freedom to choose where they want to live and the personal responsibility to construct their homes to work with that choice . ''",
            "The cost of using wildfire-resistant materials became a central sticking point .",
            "The Oregon Home Builders Association testified that the new codes would add five percent to a home 's price , potentially tens of thousands of dollars .",
            "Those numbers did n't make sense to Sartain .",
            "He had surveyed Ashland home builders , who said , for a starter home , the added cost would be between roughly $ 1,200 and $ 1,700 .",
            "A study by Headwaters Economics found fire-resistant homes can be cheaper than traditional homes , thanks in large part to using more affordable fiber-cement siding .",
            "Home builders also questioned the codes because they would only apply to new houses , not existing homes , which could still leave neighborhoods vulnerable .",
            "Fire officials responded that even a handful of fire-resistant structures can buy firefighters more time .",
            "`` If we start with one house at a time , then we have two houses , then three , then 20 , then 50 , '' Sartain says .",
            "`` It might be able to slow down a fire enough to get the resources into an area to keep it from wiping out entire communities . ''",
            "In the end , Oregon 's wildfire building codes were approved , but they 're optional .",
            "Cities and counties can choose whether to adopt them , as well as whether to apply them to individual homes or only larger subdivisions .",
            "`` That was very difficult and very frustrating , '' Sartain says .",
            "`` We would love to have seen it as a statewide adoption , but we could barely get it passed as voluntarily applied inside of a city or inside of a county .",
            "The home builders would not allow it in any way , shape or form on a statewide basis . ''",
            "After the destructive wildfires this year , the Oregon Home Builders Association says it would be supportive of a statewide wildfire building code if the state completes a detailed map of where they would apply based on fire risk , which currently does n't exist .",
            "A statewide wildfire council recommended both developing wildfire risk maps and supporting wildfire building codes in a special report in 2019 , writing that the `` patchwork of inconsistent and sometimes absent role '' of codes was posing significant risk , especially as new development grows in wildland areas .",
            "Legislation to create statewide maps failed earlier this year .",
            "`` Personally , and this is not the association 's view , this is my view : I think if you 're going to be building houses up in wooded , forested areas , if I was building a house up there , I would take measures to protect the home , '' says Justin Wood of the Oregon Home Builders Association .",
            "So far , only the city of Medford has adopted the new wildfire codes .",
            "The city of Ashland and Deschutes County are currently considering adoption .",
            "None of the more than 5,400 structures destroyed across Oregon this year will be required to meet wildfire codes if they choose to rebuild .",
            "Colorado faces pushback In Colorado , a similar story unfolded .",
            "In 2013 , after experiencing two destructive fires , Governor John Hickenlooper convened a task force to examine Colorado 's fire policy .",
            "The team included both fire officials and representatives from the building and real estate industries .",
            "In their final report , the task force found that using fire-safe materials was one of the most effective measures that property owners could take .",
            "They recommended adopting a statewide model wildfire building code , either making it mandatory in high risk areas or creating something that local governments could mandate themselves .",
            "The report noted that counties that had already adopted wildfire codes had seen encouraging results .",
            "In the 2010 Fourmile Canyon Fire , Boulder County found that 100 percent of the homes built in the decade prior survived .",
            "They had gone through a county program that required fire-resistant building materials and minimized flammable vegetation .",
            "Of the older homes that had n't completed that program , only 63 percent survived .",
            "Still , seven years later , Colorado does n't have a statewide wildfire building code .",
            "`` Not much happened , '' says Lisa Dale , who served on the wildfire task force in 2013 when she worked for the state government and is currently a lecturer at Columbia University .",
            "`` What we found was the building and the real estate industries had very powerful lobbying capacity to argue against state regulation on this issue . ''",
            "Home builders groups felt that local governments should determine their own codes and rely on educating homeowners about wildfire preparation through outreach .",
            "`` I think we question the efficacy of a statewide [ wildland-urban interface ] code , because we support local codes , '' says Ted Leighty , CEO of the Colorado Association of Home Builders .",
            "`` We believed , and still do , that codes are best developed , implemented and enforced by local governments .",
            "Each local area has unique issues and circumstances and geography . ''",
            "Today , at least 16 counties and cities have adopted wildfire building codes in Colorado , though some are limited , only specifying roofing materials .",
            "Some counties provide property inspections to help homeowners understand how they might be vulnerable .",
            "But other cities and counties have held off , which Dale says is a sign of how local governments are n't incentivized to adopt tough codes .",
            "`` We know local governments across Colorado , across the whole American West , have been historically very reluctant to take aggressive action on this issue , '' Dale says .",
            "`` Because remember , local governments get most of their revenue from property taxes .",
            "They rely on having a business-friendly environment to welcome new residents and new businesses to their borders . ''",
            "Homeowners on their own Without mandatory guidelines for building fire-resistant homes , more than 6,000 property owners in Oregon and Colorado will decide for themselves about how to rebuild after one of the worst wildfire years the two states ever experienced .",
            "Many people are still in temporary housing and waiting on the lengthy process of clearing debris and negotiating with insurance companies .",
            "So , building fire-resistant homes is n't necessarily top of mind when their basic needs are n't met .",
            "`` It 's awful , and the morale is just rock bottom , '' says fire chief Christiana Rainbow Plews of the Upper McKenzie Rural Fire Protection District in central Oregon .",
            "`` I hear it everywhere I go just how slow and frustrating the process is . ''",
            "In September , Plews and her crew responded to what they thought was a standard brush fire .",
            "But after weeks of hot weather and high winds , it quickly got out of hand , giving some residents just minutes to evacuate .",
            "The Holiday Farm Fire eventually burned more than 400 homes , including her own .",
            "`` I actually did n't know that my own home had burned for a couple of days , '' she says .",
            "`` I went through all the emotions for sure .",
            "I was very upset and it was really hard to tell my family . ''",
            "Chief Plews says she and her husband are just beginning to think about the rebuilding process and what kinds of materials they 'll use on their home .",
            "But it 's tougher for many others in her community .",
            "`` If they were under-insured or not insured , what they can afford may not be what they actually want , '' she says .",
            "`` They may have to settle for something that 's less fire-resistant . ''",
            "Hundreds are still living in hotels , unable to find even temporary housing .",
            "The biggest concern for many is building back as fast as possible , not how they 'll build their homes , Plews says .",
            "With the emotional and financial strain of the rebuilding process , the best time to prepare for future climate-driven fires is often the hardest time to do so .",

            "LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Investigations found that damaged electrical equipment ignited two Southern California wildfires last year , including one that threatened the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum , a fire agency said Thursday .",
            "The investigative results for two fires that broke out northwest of Los Angeles a year ago were released as power cuts were underway in parts of Northern California to prevent electrical equipment from igniting fires amid gusty , dry weather .",
            "The 1,800-acre ( 728-hectare ) Easy Fire , which threatened the library and nearby Simi Valley homes , ignited Oct. 30 , 2019 , when an insulator attached to a Southern California Edison power line swung into a steel power pole during windy , dry conditions , the Ventura County Fire Department said in a statement .",
            "At the time , the utility reported to state regulators that its equipment may have been involved in the fire , which damaged two buildings .",
            "The Ventura County department also said the Maria Fire near Santa Paula was ignited the next day by failure of a conductor on an electrical distribution line owned by California Resources Corp. `` Fire investigators found that an electrical conductor separated and contacted a metal pipe on the ground , igniting the fire , '' the department said .",
            "Nearly 15.6 square miles ( 40 square kilometers ) were scorched , and four buildings were damaged .",
            "California Resources Corp. , a publicly traded oil and gas exploration and production company , claimed in a statement that Southern California Edison was at fault .",
            "The fire started when Southern California Edison `` reenergized its power distribution to our field after a power safety shutdown without giving us prior notice and opportunity to inspect our equipment , '' it said .",
            "The company said it has filed a lawsuit against the utility in Ventura County Superior Court regarding the fire .",
            "Southern California Edison fully cooperated in the investigation of the Easy Fire , but it has not received the Fire Department 's report , company spokesman David Song said .",
            "The company 's ongoing internal review indicates that a circuit interrupted shortly before the fire was reported , but the cause can not be determined until the utility can analyze equipment currently in the department 's possession , he said .",
            "Southern California Edison disputes California Resource Corp. 's allegation regarding the Maria Fire but it can not comment because of the pending litigation , Song said .",
            "In Northern California , a public safety power shutoff begun by Pacific Gas & Electric on Wednesday night was underway in parts of seven counties , affecting around 31,000 customers .",
            "Changing weather allowed the utility to exclude six other counties .",
            "By Thursday night , power had been restored to all but about 8,000 customers , PG&E said .",
            "The shutoffs included parts of Butte County , where a 2018 blaze ignited by Pacific Gas & Electric equipment destroyed much of the town of Paradise and killed 85 people .",
            "Southern California , meanwhile , was benefiting from a cooling trend with night through morning low clouds and fog , and occasional drizzle .",
            "Light rain was possible during the weekend , followed by clear skies with gusty Santa Ana winds and a warming trend early next week , forecasters said .",
            "California was free of drought indicators at the start of the year , but most of the north is now deep into extreme or severe drought , according to the U.S. Drought Monitor .",
            "Moderate drought extends down the state 's eastern flank into the deserts .",
            "ut counties along the southern and central coast remain drought-free .",
            "Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal , oil and gas .",
            "Scientists say climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable .",
            "More 8,600 wildfires have scorched well over 6,400 square miles ( 16,576 square kilometers ) and destroyed about 9,200 buildings in California this year .",
            "There have been 31 deaths .",
            "All of the huge fires have been fully or significantly contained , but more than 6,000 firefighters remain committed to 19 blazes , including a dozen major incidents , the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said .",
            "Many of this year 's devastating fires were started by thousands of dry lightning strikes .",
            "But some of the fires remain under investigation for potential electrical causes ."

            "Oct. 2 -- As temperatures rise and wildfires and smoke add to the strain on the electric grid , Californians were once again urged to conserve energy to prevent rolling blackouts .",
            "The California Independent System Operator , which manages the power grid that covers most of the state , issued a call to save electricity for Thursday between 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Air conditioner use -- a major source of power demand on hot days -- was a big part of the issue .",
            "But at the same time , the grid operator said , fire activity and `` reduced capacity '' also contributed to the state 's potential energy shortage .",
            "Officials said some major transmission lines were under threat from wildfires ; smoke was reducing solar power generation ; and some power producers were offline due to fires ( it was not immediately clear what power plants were unavailable ) .",
            "Neither PG&E nor California ISO officials were able to specify which transmission lines were under threat from the wildfires or which communities they serve or what power production facilities were offline due to the fire .",
            "Anne Gonzales , spokesperson for California ISO , said that wildfires generally pose a risk to transmission lines because of where they are usually located throughout the state .",
            "`` During wildfire season , which is getting longer and longer each year , it 's a particular danger for transmission lines because they 're are usually in rugged remote areas of the state .",
            "And that 's where fires are usually present , '' said Gonzales . ''",
            "Fires in those areas also makes it harder for firefighters to fight them . ''",
            "Maggie Winslow , director of the master of science in energy management systems program at the University of San Francisco , noted that utilities companies like PG&E sometimes shut down transmission lines so they do n't spark fires .",
            "She also said that when the lines get really hot , not much energy can be transferred through them .",
            "`` I do n't actually know if there were any lines that got burned up in the fires we 've had in California so , but that certainly can happen , '' Winslow said .",
            "Some communities in Napa and Sonoma counties lost power due to disruptions related to the fires ; a PG&E official tweeted Thursday that the company is `` working with first responders to restore power safely and as quickly as possible to the those who can receive electric service after the #GlassFire in the North Bay . ''",
            "To avoid power disruptions Thursday afternoon , people can set their thermostats to 78 degrees or higher , turn off unnecessary lights , unplug devices and not leave the refrigerator door open for extended periods of time .",
            "Grid officials also urged consumers to `` pre-cool '' their homes before the energy conservation request , called a Flex Alert , kicked in at 3 p.m. , and not to charge electric cars during the energy conservation request .",
            "The state saw rolling blackouts for two days in August during a prolonged heat wave , but escaped threatened blackouts on other occasions partly due to strong energy-saving efforts .",
            "`` Flex Alerts are a really great way for everybody to do their part to keep the grid balanced .",
            "That program has produced good results because with electricity , you have to use it or lose it , '' said Stephanie Siehr , professor of energy management at the University of San Francisco .",
            "`` We 're facing now , yet again , another high heat event , which causes a surge in demand for cooling so that kind of throws up the usual operation of the grid .",
            "The Flex Alert is trying to smooth out and balance so that we do n't have to do rotating outages , '' Siehr said .",

            "The 13-bedroom Italian palazzo-style mansion and surrounding 9.87-acre estate in the ultra-affluent , guard-gated Beverly Park community is likely to be the most expensive home ever to sell at auction in the U.S.",

            "SAN FRANCISCO -- Firefighters and aircraft from 10 states began arriving in California Friday to help weary crews battling some of the largest blazes in state history as weekend weather threatened to renew the advance of flames that have killed six people and incinerated hundreds of homes .",
            "Some 560 wildfires were burning throughout the state but many were small and remote .",
            "The bulk of damage was from three clusters of blazes that were ravaging forest and rural areas in the wine country and San Francisco Bay Area .",
            "Those complexes , consisting of dozens of fires , exploded in size Friday .",
            "Together , they had scorched 991 square miles and destroyed more than 500 homes and other buildings , fire officials said .",
            "They cover a collective 771,000 acres -- larger than the size of Rhode Island .",
            "At least 100,000 people were under evacuation orders .",
            "Two Bay Area clusters , the LNU Lightning Complex and the SCU Lightning Complex , became respectively the second - and third-largest wildfires in recent state history by size , according to Cal Fire records .",
            "The third blaze , the CZU Lightning Complex , is in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties .",
            "The fires were sparked by lightning from unsettled weather earlier in the week .",
            "Cooler , more humid weather overnight helped firefighters make ground against the fires but the National Weather Service issued a fire weather watch from Sunday morning into Tuesday for the entire Bay Area and central coast .",
            "Forecasters said there was a chance of thunderstorms bringing more lightning and erratic gusts .",
            "More than 12,000 personnel were fighting fires around the state , aided by fleets of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft .",
            "By Friday , the state 's fire agency , Cal Fire , had called out 96 % of its available fire engines .",
            "But reinforcements began to arrive .",
            "The number of personnel assigned to the LNU complex , in the heart of wine country north of San Francisco , more than doubled from 580 to over 1,400 Friday and nearly 200 fire engines were on the scene , fire officials said .",
            "`` I 'm happy to see the jumps that we 've had today , '' said Sean Kavanaugh , Cal Fire incident commander .",
            "That could help crews make further progress against the sprawling fire , which was just 15 % contained .",
            "Most evacuations for the town of Vacaville were lifted Friday .",
            "The fire threat there was reduced after reaching the edges of town .",
            "`` I feel like we 're up on our feet , standing straight and actually moving a little bit forward , '' Kavanaugh said Friday night .",
            "However , the number of large fires was `` staggering '' and had put `` tremendous strain '' on firefighting resources throughout the Western states , he said .",
            "Nevada and Arizona , for example , have battled sizable blazes this week as a heat wave swept the West .",
            "Gov.",
            "Gavin Newsom said 10 states were sending personnel and equipment .",
            "The governor also said he was reaching out to Canada and Australia for help .",
            "`` We have more people but it 's not enough , '' Newsom said .",
            "In the Santa Cruz mountains south of San Francisco , about 1,000 firefighters were battling a fire 10 times the size they typically would cover , said Dan Olsen , a Cal Fire spokesman .",
            "With firefighting resources tight , homes in remote , hard-to-get-to places burned unattended .",
            "Cal Fire Chief Mark Brunton pleaded with residents to quit battling fires on their own , saying that just causes more problems for the professionals .",
            "`` We had last night three separate rescues that pulled our vital , very few resources away , '' he said .",
            "But Peter Koleckai credits a neighbor , not firefighters , with saving his home in a rural area where dozens of homes were reduced to smoldering ruins .",
            "`` We were here at about 3 o'clock in the morning and the fire department just left .",
            "They just left , '' he said .",
            "Koleckai said he ran to a firefighter and told him a brush fire was erupting next to a house .",
            "`` They never went up there and it engulfed the whole house , took the house out , '' he said .",
            "A neighbor with a high pressure hose , firefighting equipment and a generator saved his home , Koleckai said .",
            "Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mike Smith said typically a wildfire of the size burning through the region would have 10 or even 20 times as many firefighters .",
            "`` We are doing absolutely everything we can , '' he said .",
            "The death toll from California fires has reached at least six .",
            "Three bodies were found Thursday in a burned home in Napa County , said Henry Wofford , a Sheriff 's Office spokesman .",

            "BEN LOMOND , Calif. -- Wildfires ravaged and menaced communities from Napa 's wine country to the coast above Santa Cruz on Friday , forcing California officials to make tough choices on which ones to fight as the state braced for a weekend that could include more lightning strikes .",
            "In some places , officials said they were being turned down for state help and left to beg equipment and manpower from volunteers and local agencies .",
            "`` Many of these firefighters have been on the lines for 72 hours , and everybody is running on fumes , '' said Assemblyman Jim Wood ( D-Healdsburg ) , whose district includes wine country areas currently under siege .",
            "`` Our first responders are working to the ragged edge of everything they have . ''",
            "More than 930,000 acres have burned so far in Northern and central California -- an area larger than the land mass of Rhode Island -- with little containment , in part because firefighting resources are stretched beyond capacity by the number of blazes .",

            "But by Friday , there were about 560 active blazes , including two separate groups of fires , known as the LNU Lightning Complex and the SCU Lightning Complex , that have resulted from the convergence of about two dozen fires .",

            "Those strikes may be causing `` holdover fires '' that can ignite and appear days or weeks later after smoldering undetected , he said .",
            "Tony Scardina , deputy regional forester for the U.S. Forest Service , said the state 's 18 federal parks have also seen up to a 300 % increase in campfires sparking wildfires this year , as more people seek the wilderness as a getaway from pandemic quarantines .",
            "The National Weather Service in Sacramento issued a weather watch from Sunday through Tuesday mornings for dry lightning from the state capital to Lassen County near the Oregon border .",
            "Though the heat wave that helped explode so many recent fires has broken , the possibility of new storms were crushing to many firefighters , 12,000 of whom are battling both flames and fatigue .",
            "With more need than can be met by the crews available , fire experts said state officials are now forced to prioritize which fires will get resources and change how those resources are being used .",
            "Though officials often deploy crews and equipment to surround fires with defensible lines so that they can be contained , fire experts said the focus is now is on saving lives and structures , and predict that the current blazes will burn for weeks .",

            "Scardina , the U.S. Forest Service official , said priorities are being set by state and federal authorities continually evaluating the larger picture of where they will have the most impact to protect lives , property and infrastructure , but the calculations are difficult .",

            "Their force , which is 27 strong , is being supplemented by retirees , many fighting to save their own homes .",
            "Todd Ellis , a Menlo Park Fire Department training captain who lives in town and is captain of the volunteer force , on Friday persuaded his chief to send a engine , which arrived in time to fight a blaze at a retreat center amid redwoods .",
            "Billy See , one of the Cal Fire incident commanders , said personnel on this fire increased by almost 100 from the previous night , up to about 1,000 , but it 's `` still not enough . ''",

            "In the Solano County city of Vacaville , halfway between Sacramento and San Francisco , some residents were able to return home from evacuations Friday , and officials reported the blaze was 15 % contained .",
            "But on the northern part of that fire , new evacuation orders were issued for the Napa County enclave of Guerneville , where the blaze was burning strongly in rugged territory .",
            "Newsom said the state sent assistance to that fire overnight , nearly doubling the number of firefighters from about 587 yesterday to more than 1,000 Friday .",
            "California in recent weeks has also hired 830 seasonal firefighters meant to replace prison crews that are not available due to early releases prompted by the pandemic .",
            "Newsom also said Friday that 10 states had offered mutual aid to California so far , and he has sent out more requests , including to Canada and Australia .",
            "So far , dozens of extra engines , manpower , airplanes and other resources have arrived from Oregon , Arizona and other states .",
            "But there is also the threat of a long fire season , with the current blazes burning for weeks -- a scenario experts said was possible with containment a lesser priority .",
            "Smoke is also hampering aerial firefighting .",
            "There are so many conflagrations in California that aircraft have been hopscotching across the state trying to slow ones that pose the greatest threats , officials said .",
            "Smoke from the LNU Lightning Complex fire has at times settled over the area and kept scouting aircraft from descending low enough to see where the blaze was most active .",
            "Such `` air attack '' provides intelligence for crews on the ground and guides other aerial endeavors .",
            "`` You just avoid the areas where there 's no visibility , '' said Scott Ross , public information officer on the LNU Complex fire .",
            "`` If you did n't have air attack , you would n't have fixed-wing tankers , helicopters , they 'd all just be flying up there willy-nilly . ''",
            "Meanwhile , the SCU Lightning Complex fire , threatening rural areas around Silicon Valley , has only three water-dropping helicopters helping at a given time because the flames have stayed mostly in rugged terrain , said public information officer Dominic Polito .",
            "Nationally , the fire threat is also at its highest level .",
            "Some 90 large fires have burned in 14 states , leaving many places taxed for resources , according to federal fire authorities .",
            "`` We have more people , but it 's not enough , '' said Newsom .",
            "`` We have more air support , but it 's still not enough . ''",

            "Firefighters on Saturday were battling dangerous blazes from the Santa Cruz Mountains to wine country and beyond , using a small break in the weather amid warnings that more lightning _ which sparked many of the fires _ could return Sunday .",

            "Gavin Newsom announced that the White House has approved California 's request for a presidential major disaster declaration to bolster the state 's emergency response to wildfires burning in Northern California .",
            "The burning of about 1.1 million acres in California in just a month , according to a LA Times analysis , is an astonishing toll so early in fire season .",

            "In all , more than 977,000 acres have burned in Northern and central California _ the equivalent of more than 1,500 square miles , three times the size of the city of Los Angeles .",
            "At least 744 structures have been destroyed in the last month .",
            "Nearly a million acres have burned since Aug. 15 , which marked the start of a `` lightning siege '' during which 12,000 strikes started 585 new wildland fires , officials said Saturday .",
            "The blazes include the LNU Lightning Complex fire , which at more than 314,000 acres is the second-largest fire in California history .",
            "The SCU Lightning Complex fire , currently covering more than 291,000 acres , is third-largest .",
            "The fires , fanned by strong winds , heat and low humidity , have forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate and prompted the National Guard and U.S. military to send assistance .",
            "The Guard is providing helicopter support and a dozen 20-person crews to fires throughout the state , and the military has sent several C-130 aircraft specially equipped to act as air tankers , said Jeremy Rahn , public information officer for the LNU fire .",
            "Even so , authorities are reporting depleted resources , with manpower and tools stretched thin by the sheer scale and number of fires across the state .",
            "One of the biggest concerns was the CZU August Lightning Complex fire , which was raging in the remote mountainous area southwest of Silicon Valley , on the border of San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties .",

            "Four civilians have died .",
            "There were about 1,429 personnel fighting the fire as of Saturday , which Cal Fire Incident Commander Sean Kavanaugh contrasted with the Mendocino Complex fire in 2018 , which drew about 5,000 personnel , and the Wine Country fires of 2017 , to which nearly 6,000 firefighters were assigned .",
            "Still , the fire remains the state 's top priority for resources as they become available , Shana Jones , Cal Fire unit chief , said Saturday .",
            "`` Within an incident of this size and complexity , and with all of the fire activity throughout the state , all of our resources remain stretched to a capacity that we have not seen in recent history , '' she said .",

            "Remnant moisture and atmospheric instability from what was once Hurricane Genevieve was expected to lift up over the area , bringing a threat of thunderstorms capable of producing 50-mph winds and cloud-to-ground lightning strikes , said Cindy Palmer , meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Monterey .",
            "She said that normally forecasters ' primary fear would be that the lightning strikes would start new fires , as the thunderstorms wo n't generate enough rain to suppress the flames .",
            "`` But because we have fire already on the ground , we 're really concerned about the gusty and erratic winds as well , '' she said .",
            "Lightning was already striking off the coast , about 500 miles southwest of San Francisco , on Saturday afternoon , she said .",
            "Forecasters were predicting the brunt of the storm activity would hit California on Sunday into Monday .",

            "Edison spokesman Chris Abel said wind speeds in the mountains above the city of Irvine at the time had not reached the threshold to pull the plug on the power , though they did later in the morning when some electric circuits were cut .",

            "That blaze and the Blue Ridge Fire farther north in the county , which broke out several hours later in the brushy hills of Yorba Linda , kept more than 70,000 people from their homes Tuesday as winds returned , but not as strongly as the day before when they blew over tractor-trailers and grounded firefighting aircraft .",
            "Two firefighters who battled the Silverado Fire remained in critical condition after suffering second - and third-degree burns over large portions of their bodies , Orange County Fire Authority Chief Brian Fennessey said .",
            "`` It 's tough for any firefighter , certainly any fire chief ... , to feel this helpless when you 've got part of our fire family fighting for their lives , '' Fennessey said at a Tuesday news conference .",
            "At least 10 homes were damaged and thousands of homes remained threatened as flames moved toward neighborhoods .",
            "There was little containment of the fires , though weather conditions were improving .",

            "As of Tuesday afternoon , some 14,500 of Edison 's 5 million customers were without power , Abel said .",
            "A study by the Manhattan Institute last year found that PG&E was far more likely to institute emergency shutoffs -- and cut off power to far more people -- than Edison in Southern California .",
            "PG&E was driven into bankruptcy in January 2019 from the costs of wildfires caused by its equipment .",
            "Jonathan Lesser , an adjunct fellow at the conservative think tank and coauthor of the report , said catastrophic fires caused by failing electric equipment or debris blowing into powerlines are outliers .",

            "`` I do n't know why they did not shut power off , '' said attorney Gerald Singleton , who has sued utilities for devastating wildfires caused by their equipment .",
            "`` They seem to be still be operating as if climate change and all these things we 're dealing with are not a reality . ''",
            "The utility defended its decision not to institute a type of blackout used increasingly as a means of protecting residents after several devastating wildfires , including a 2018 inferno sparked by PG&E equipment that nearly razed the community of Paradise , killed 85 people and destroyed 19,000 homes and other buildings .",
            "Edison spokesman Chris Abel said wind speeds in the mountains above the city of Irvine at the time had not reached the threshold to pull the plug on the power , though they did later in the morning when some electric circuits were cut .",
            "`` It 's not something that we take lightly , '' Abel said of the decision to shut off electricity .",
            "`` We know that not having power is a tremendous burden on our customers . ''",
            "The Silverado Fire broke out in gusty weather just before 7 a.m. Monday near Irvine , a city of 280,000 about 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) south of Los Angeles .",
            "According to SoCal Edison 's report to state utility regulators , a `` lashing wire '' that ties a telecommunications line to a supporting cable may have come into contact with a separate 12,000-volt Edison conductor line above .",
            "That blaze and the Blue Ridge Fire farther north in the county , which broke out several hours later in the brushy hills of Yorba Linda , kept more than 70,000 people from their homes Tuesday as winds returned , but not as strongly as the day before when they blew over tractor-trailers and grounded firefighting aircraft .",
            "Some evacuation orders were canceled during the day but a few new orders or warnings were added as the Blue Ridge Fire advanced .",
            "The winds were subsiding and Wednesday through the rest of the week should be calm , the National Weather Service said .",
            "Two firefighters who battled the Silverado Fire remained in critical condition after suffering second - and third-degree burns over large portions of their bodies , Orange County Fire Authority Chief Brian Fennessey said .",
            "`` It 's tough for any firefighter , certainly any fire chief ... , to feel this helpless when you 've got part of our fire family fighting for their lives , '' Fennessey said at a Tuesday news conference .",
            "Three other firefighters had suffered lesser injuries battling the blazes .",
            "At least 10 homes were damaged and thousands of homes remained threatened as flames moved toward neighborhoods .",
            "There was little containment of the fires , though weather conditions were improving .",

            "LOS ANGELES -- ( AP ) -- Facing extreme wildfire conditions this week that included hurricane-level winds , the main utility in Northern California cut power to nearly 1 million people while its counterpart in Southern California pulled the plug on just 30 customers to prevent power lines and other electrical equipment from sparking a blaze .",
            "Pacific Gas & Electric Co. avoided major wildfires during its outage , while Southern California Edison is trying to determine if one of its power lines started a massive fire that drove nearly 100,000 people from their homes in Orange County during fierce winds and extremely dry conditions early Monday .",
            "`` I do n't know why they did not shut power off , '' said attorney Gerald Singleton , who has sued utilities for devastating wildfires caused by their equipment .",
            "`` They seem to be still be operating as if climate change and all these things we 're dealing with are not a reality . ''",
            "The utility defended its decision not to institute a type of blackout used increasingly as a means of protecting residents after several devastating wildfires , including a 2018 inferno sparked by PG&E equipment that nearly razed the community of Paradise , killed 85 people and destroyed 19,000 homes and other buildings .",
            "Edison spokesman Chris Abel said wind speeds in the mountains above the city of Irvine at the time had not reached the threshold to pull the plug on the power , though they did later in the morning when some electric circuits were cut .",
            "`` It 's not something that we take lightly , '' Abel said of the decision to shut off electricity .",
            "`` We know that not having power is a tremendous burden on our customers . ''",
            "The Silverado Fire broke out in gusty weather just before 7 a.m. Monday near Irvine , a city of 280,000 about 35 miles ( 56 kilometers ) south of Los Angeles .",
            "According to SoCal Edison 's report to state utility regulators , a `` lashing wire '' that ties a telecommunications line to a supporting cable may have come into contact with a separate 12,000-volt Edison conductor line above .",
            "That blaze and the Blue Ridge Fire farther north in the county , which broke out several hours later in the brushy hills of Yorba Linda , kept more than 70,000 people from their homes Tuesday as winds returned , but not as strongly as the day before when they blew over tractor-trailers and grounded firefighting aircraft .",
            "Some evacuation orders were canceled during the day but a few new orders or warnings were added as the Blue Ridge Fire advanced .",
            "The winds were subsiding and Wednesday through the rest of the week should be calm , the National Weather Service said .",
            "However , forecasts called for continued warm , dry weather around the state into November , without a trace of rain .",
            "Two firefighters who battled the Silverado Fire remained in critical condition after suffering second - and third-degree burns over large portions of their bodies , Orange County Fire Authority Chief Brian Fennessey said .",
            "`` It 's tough for any firefighter , certainly any fire chief ... , to feel this helpless when you 've got part of our fire family fighting for their lives , '' Fennessey said at a Tuesday news conference .",
            "Three other firefighters had suffered lesser injuries battling the blazes .",
            "At least 10 homes were damaged and thousands of homes remained threatened as flames moved toward neighborhoods .",
            "There was little containment of the fires , though weather conditions were improving .",
            "The fires moved with extraordinary speed and residents described the fear they felt when told to evacuate and then having to navigate through orange-tinted smoke on traffic-choked roads .",
            "Elizabeth Akhparyan Park and her husband , Tony , initially heeded the warning when smoke darkened their Irvine home even though they could n't see fire .",
            "After joining their three children at her mother 's home in Tustin , they decided to return at night for more keepsakes .",
            "They fled the second time with photo albums and her husband 's violin after seeing flames across the road and hearing police say it was time to go .",
            "`` Now I see it , now I 've got to go , '' Park recalled .",
            "`` The windows were shaking , the upstairs patio had the chairs flying around . ''",
            "In Northern California , two dozen wildfires reported since Sunday were rapidly contained without serious damage .",
            "Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger expired and easing winds allowed PG&E to begin restoring power after the largest of five safety shutoffs this year .",
            "At its peak , PG&E cut power to about 345,000 customers -- nearly 1 million people -- in 34 counties .",
            "The nation 's largest utility said it restored power to more than 300,000 customers , and expected to nearly complete the work by late Tuesday night , with a small number having to wait until Wednesday after crews do inspections to make repairs and ensure equipment is safe .",
            "PG&E said it received more than 130 reports of damage or hazards to its equipment .",
            "Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable .",
            "October and November are traditionally the worst months for fires , but already this year 8,600 wildfires in the state have scorched a record 6,400 square miles ( 16,600 square kilometers ) and destroyed about 9,200 homes , businesses and other buildings .",
            "There have been 31 deaths .",
            "Gov.",
            "Gavin Newsom said Tuesday that 42 wildfires had erupted over the 24 hours that ended Tuesday morning .",
            "When the Orange County fires broke out Monday morning , Edison had only cut power to 30 customers in the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles .",
            "As of Tuesday night , only about 2,000 of Edison 's 5 million customers were without power , according to an outage website .",
            "A study by the Manhattan Institute last year found that PG&E was far more likely to institute emergency shutoffs -- and cut off power to far more people -- than Edison in Southern California .",
            "PG&E was driven into bankruptcy in January 2019 from the costs of wildfires caused by its equipment .",
            "Jonathan Lesser , an adjunct fellow at the conservative think tank and coauthor of the report , said catastrophic fires caused by failing electric equipment or debris blowing into powerlines are outliers .",
            "Some of the largest fires in state history burned this year and were sparked by lightning .",
            "Lesser said preemptive blackouts are like a cheap insurance policy for utilities that do n't have to account for costs to hundreds of thousands of customers who lose power .",
            "When the lights go out , many businesses are forced to close , homeowners have to toss spoiled food and vital medical equipment ca n't be used .",
            "`` Obviously , you can say in retrospect that it would have been better if SCE cut power where the line was .",
            "But that 's not how risk analysis works , '' Lesser said .",
            "`` You ca n't approach this as would have , could have , should have . ''",

            "Firefighters already battling the blaze in steep , rugged terrain with scorching heat faced more hurdles when hundreds of lightning strikes and winds up to 15 mph ( 24 kph ) pushed the flames uphill .",
            "`` We set up a containment line at the top of the hills so the fire does n't spill over to the other side and cause it to spread , but it was obviously difficult given the erratic wind and some other conditions , '' said fire spokesman Jake Miller .",
            "The Lake Fire was just 12 % contained Sunday and has burned nearly 28 square miles ( 72 square kilometers ) of brush and trees .",

            "Ryan Peel said firefighters created some defensive space around his slot machine distribution warehouse in Chilcoot , but he was worried the erratic winds could still put his business in the line of fire .",
            "`` Yesterday was extremely emotional , as we were at the mercy of the wind and the unpredictability of the fire , '' Peel told The Associated Press .",

            "The smoke was so thick that the weather service reported at 11 a.m. that the visibility in the region was anywhere from three miles to only three-quarters of a mile .",
            "Meteorologist Drew Peterson said the weather service received reports from observers at the Farallon Islands off the coast of San Francisco that visibility Friday morning was down to 1/16th of a mile .",
            "`` It 's exceptionally dense , '' Peterson said .",
            "`` It 's blocking out the sun and allowing an even stronger marine layer and fog to move into the area .",
            "Unfortunately , that marine layer is filled with the smoke , and the smoke is mixing with the fog . ''",
            "The smoke caused the cancellation of all horse racing at Golden Gate Fields in Albany , shut down tours of Alcatraz Island and closed Muir Woods .",
            "In a social media post , the air district said conditions were not expected to improve Friday and that the `` air quality may degrade as more smoke is expected to mix down to the ground . ''",
            "Light overnight winds allowed smoke to seep down from above the shallow marine layer , resulting in widespread Unhealthy & Very Unhealthy conditions .",
            "We do not anticipate conditions to improve today , and air quality may degrade as more smoke is expected to mix down to the ground .",
            "pic.twitter.com/I1wvhOhFNi -- Bay Area Air Quality ( @AirDistrict ) September 11 , 2020 The air quality has gotten worse as the winds associated with the marine layer that arrived Monday have gradually weakened .",
            "That has caused fine air pollutants that were above the layer to become mixed with the marine layer in an event that Peterson called `` turbulent mixing . ''",
            "`` As that happens , gravity has taken over , '' he said .",
            "Neither the air quality nor the visibility figures to improve until Sunday , according to Peterson .",
            "Forecasters are tracking what he called a `` vigorous '' low-pressure system that may act as a cleanser .",
            "`` What we 're expecting is an entirely new fresh air mass coming into the region , replacing the one we have , '' he said , adding that as the system arrives , `` the smoke will not be as concentrated .",
            "It 's still going to be everywhere , but it wo n't be as concentrated .",
            "It 'll be spread out over a larger area , and that should help . ''"

            "Historic wildfires raging from California to Colorado are weakening watersheds and setting the stage for deadly mudslides and flooding and , in some places , threatening to poison critical water supplies .",
            "Fueled by record-setting temperatures and strong winds , blazes are wreaking havoc in the West , decimating entire towns like Malden in eastern Washington state , where 80 % of the homes and structures -- from the fire station to city hall -- were burned to the ground .",
            "But the fires do n't just pose a threat to things that burn .",
            "More intense and larger fires are also shifting the very ground in Western states .",
            "Severe wildfires can change the hydrologic response of a watershed so quickly that even a relatively modest rainstorm can trigger flash floods and steep terrain debris flows , said Jason Kean , a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey 's Landslide Hazards Program in Golden , Colo. `` A debris flow is kind of like a flood on steroids , '' said Kean .",
            "`` It 's all bulked up with rocks , mud , boulders , and then it becomes a different animal that can be even more destructive than a flood . ''",
            "Burned and denuded land no longer has the vegetative root structure to help stabilize the soil and is easily eroded by rain , Kean said , adding that the land also ca n't absorb water the way it did before the fire .",
            "High-severity fires can also cause soil surfaces to harden or even cause soil to repel water , Kean said .",
            "It 's a scenario that 's played out more and more as the size and intensity of fires grow in a warming world .",
            "In December of 2017 , one of the largest fires in California -- the massive Thomas wildfire -- burned through large swaths of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties .",
            "In January , before the fire was contained , intense bursts of rain fell on a portion of the burn area above the city of Montecito , Calif. , weakening the watershed there .",
            "A massive slew of boulders and debris overwhelmed the town without warning , killing 23 people and destroying more than 400 homes in its path .",
            "Another lesser-known threat to the region 's water is gaining attention in urban areas affected by wildfires : chemical contamination .",
            "In cities that have experienced devastating fires , water officials are finding cancer-causing benzene and other volatile organic compounds in contaminated and fire-damaged water infrastructure .",

            "Andrew Whelton , an associate professor of civil , environmental and ecological engineering at Purdue University , said such contamination is gaining more attention -- and scrutiny -- given the lack of water testing after wildfires .",
            "`` We do n't know if this has happened prior to 2017 because , as it turns out , states and municipalities and first responders did n't test drinking water systems that have been struck by fire for that type of contamination , '' said Whelton .",

            "He and his colleagues generate hazard maps showing which drainage basins are most susceptible to debris flows , as well as estimates for how much rain it would take to trigger those flows , levels called `` rainfall thresholds . ''",
            "The National Weather Service then uses those readings when watching the rains in the winter to alert residents when to prepare to evacuate or issue warnings , he said .",
            "The biggest warning flag : intense bursts of rain that can trigger fast-moving floods and pick up large amounts of debris .",
            "Kean and his team still have time to prepare and plan for California 's winter rains , and a blanket of snow is currently hampering fires in Colorado without the risk of floods .",
            "But he admits his job has grown more difficult because his team is small but has a national scope , and each fire has its own issues .",
            "`` When it 's happening all at once , '' he said , `` it 's hard to keep it all straight . ''",
            "Depending on the size and intensity of the fire , Kean said it can take two to five years , and in some cases longer , for vegetation to grow back and a watershed to heal .",
            "Until that happens , there 's a threat of flooding , debris flows , mudslides and contamination if polluted soil is moved to the water .",
            "`` Every place recovers a little bit differently and at a different rate .",
            "A fire in coastal Southern California might recover faster than a fire in Colorado , '' he said .",
            "`` Generally speaking , with each year after the fire , the amount of rain it takes to cause a problem goes up , so those rainfall thresholds go up each year . ''",
            "In California , geology has facilitated disaster .",
            "The region is known for having `` alluvial fans , '' slopes created over long periods of time that start at a narrow point and spread into the shape of an upside-down fan or ice cream cone .",
            "A task force that analyzed the Thomas Fire found that debris flows are a common characteristic of alluvial fans ( Greenwire , Jan. 22 ) .",
            "And the same explosive conditions that can trigger mudslides and debris flows can also unearth or move contaminants into nearby rivers and streams -- from charred industrial sites , cars and homes , or even former mining sites where fire and then water strip away soil and vegetation keeping metals or other materials in place .",
            "One USGS study found that a wildfire in 2010 near Boulder , Colo. , that had burned a forested watershed had also changed the soil 's hydrology and mobilized arsenic and metals from legacy mining sites in the area , creating a risk to water supplies .",
            "Sheila Murphy , a hydrologist at USGS who co-authored the study , said that unlike a chemical spill that causes an immediate impact on water quality , effects of a wildfire may take months or even years to become evident .",
            "`` There 's a lot of focus on the fire when it 's happening , like ` My gosh , these homes are burning ; these buildings are damaged .",
            "How do we get the fire out and save these people 's lives ? '",
            "'' said Murphy .",
            "`` The issue you see with water effects is often very delayed . ''",
            "Among the complicating factors is the whipsaw seen with weather .",
            "`` Yesterday , it was 90-something degrees [ Fahrenheit ] here in Colorado and we were getting ash deposition from the fires , and now it 's 32 degrees and it 's snowing , '' said Murphy .",
            "`` It 's kind of a little roulette . ''",
            "Sediment , contaminants As the severity and size of wildfires grow , so do a series of complex threats to the nation 's water systems -- from debris to dangerous pollution , depending on the location and type of fire .",
            "Wildfires that only affect wildlands with no urban fill or homes generate sediment and debris that will be washed into nearby bodies of water , all of which can affect smell or taste of drinking water depending on what nearby communities rely upon , said Newsha Ajami , director of Urban Water Policy with Stanford University 's Water in the West program .",
            "If a wildfire destroys homes , cars or other facilities , more concerning debris will need to be managed before the next storm or rain event to control for metals , chemicals and oils .",
            "Lastly , there 's no way to control for ash and smoke from wildfires that travel far distances and eventually precipitate on soil and water far from the site of the fire .",
            "Clint Snyder , assistant executive director of the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board in Redding , Calif. , said water sources like lakes that feed drinking water plants can become overloaded with sediment and debris , creating challenges for treating drinking water .",
            "Smaller systems will have to move to boiling notices if the plants are taken offline .",
            "Unlike fires that are isolated to timberlands , fires that occur in more urban environments are found to have increased concentrations of total and dissolved metals ; chemicals released from burning coal , oil , gasoline and trash known as `` polyaromatic hydrocarbons '' ; and things like E. coli bacteria , said Snyder .",
            "Another emerging threat in Northern California is contamination from benzene , a volatile compound linked to cancer , and other volatile organic compounds that have been found in damaged water distribution systems following massive fires .",
            "EPA officials in an interview said they 're actively researching how wildfires affect plastic water piping in the distribution system .",
            "`` It 's beyond the treatment facility ; it 's happening in the distribution line going to households , potentially into their plumbing , so this is a whole new area that we 're engaged with our Office of Research and Development , '' said Corine Li , manager of EPA 's drinking water office for the Pacific Southwest region .",
            "For now , it 's still unknown how chemicals like benzene enter drinking water distribution systems , said Whelton .",
            "`` There is n't 10 or 15 years of ` This is how it works ; this is the effect , ' '' he said .",
            "`` We have to be more agile in how we respond because we do n't know that much about it , so we have to keep an open mind . ''",
            "Whelton said the state of California believes that smoke gets sucked into the water system when pressure is lost in water systems damaged by fire -- smoke that carries particulates , volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and semi-volatile organic compounds ( SVOCs ) that mix with the water and leach out .",
            "Yet another theory , he said , is that underground plastic pipes and meters are heated during a wildfire , basically `` cooking plastic underground . ''",
            "Those materials , according to the theory , then release VOC and SVOC byproducts that enter into the drinking water , since they ca n't escape into the air .",
            "`` The complicating issue is that contaminated water gets drawn into buildings and basically incapacitates the building because you contaminate the plumbing , '' said Whelton .",
            "`` That 's new , in that it was n't really known before . ''"

            "While the cause of the fire is under investigation , officials said Monday it was possibly sparked by embers from the Glass fire on the other side of the Napa Valley .",
            "Winds Sunday night were blowing steadily between 40 and 60 mph across the North Bay hills , with some gusts up to 65 mph , said National Weather Service meteorologist Anna Schneider .",
            "While it was n't remarkably warm Sunday night , the air was extremely dry because it was being pulled over inland mountains from the hot , dry Great Basin , sapping it of any moisture as it traveled downslope and across the valley floor .",
            "When the winds reached the 20-acre spot fire on the other side of the valley , they pushed it west toward Sonoma County and uphill into that one unburned area of the forest where it could flourish .",

            "`` In contrast , neighborhood outages typically take a single crew 4-6 hours to restore power to a much smaller group of customers . ''",
            "The statement added that DWP crews `` have been working around the clock on 16-hour shifts since Saturday and will continue until every last customer is restored .",

            "Nearly two years ago , President Donald Trump stood amid the smoky ruins of Paradise , California , where he blamed the deadliest wildfire in the state 's history on poor forest management .",
            "`` You 've got to take care of the floors , you know ?",
            "The floors of the forest , very important , '' the president said .",
            "He ordered the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Interior to make federal lands less susceptible to catastrophic wildfires with measures such as removing dead trees , underbrush and other potentially flammable materials .",
            "But while Trump has accused California and Democratic Gov.",
            "Gavin Newsom of doing a `` terrible job '' of forest protection , his own agencies fell short of his goals for federal lands in 2019 .",
            "They treated a combined 6,736 square miles ( 17,446 square kilometers ) -- just over half of the 13,203 square miles ( 34,196 square kilometers ) the president sought , according to government data .",
            "It was only slightly better than their average annual performance over nearly two decades .",
            "Without directly addressing the figures , the Forest Service said in a statement Friday to the Associated Press that prospects are `` very good '' for stepping up forest treatments in the next several years , assuming Congress provides more funding and state and private landowners play bigger roles .",
            "The agency has formed stewardship agreements with 19 states and `` will rely on partnerships with state governments to get this work done , '' it said .",
            "The numbers show it will take more than executive orders to make significant progress on a problem that has been building for a century , scientists and advocates say .",
            "More money and personnel are needed , along with policy changes .",
            "`` The fires are getting bigger , the fire seasons are longer and costs are significantly increasing , '' said Dylan Kruse , director of government affairs for Sustainable Northwest , a Portland , Oregon-based nonprofit that seeks collaboration between forest industries and conservationists .",
            "`` We need billions of dollars and we 're not even close . ''",
            "Trump and Congress have provided only modest spending increases for forest treatments in recent years , he said .",
            "The president sought a nearly $ 50 million cut in 2018 , which lawmakers rejected .",
            "His 2021 budget recommends $ 510 million , up from $ 445 million allocated this year .",
            "Trump has drawn ridicule from political foes and some scientists for arguing that western forest floors should be `` raked '' and ignoring the role of climate change-induced warming and drought in the West 's worsening wildfire crisis .",
            "But protection measures like those sought in his 2018 executive order have drawn support from administrations of both parties for two decades .",
            "A national fire plan developed under President Bill Clinton and continued under President George W. Bush called for hazardous fuel reduction and suppressing invasive beetles , along with restoration of burned-over lands to prevent erosion .",
            "The Obama administration released a fire management strategy that embraced fuel removal and controlled burns .",
            "The amount of land receiving such treatments from the Forest Service and Department of Interior has edged upward , peaking at 10,469 square miles ( 27,115 square kilometers ) in 2009 before declining to almost half that for several years .",
            "It jumped to 8,505 square miles ( 22,027 square kilometers ) in 2016 -- President Barack Obama 's last year in office .",
            "Under Trump , the treated area has gone from 6,367 square miles ( 16,490 square kilometers ) in 2017 to nearly 7,336 square miles ( 19,000 square kilometers ) in 2018 .",
            "Last year it was up to 6,736 square miles ( 17,446 square kilometers ) .",
            "Still , the Forest Service says 125,000 square miles ( 323,748 square kilometers ) it manages need work such as tree thinning and regulated burns to reduce fuel loads .",
            "The agency estimates many times more that much government and private land is vulnerable to severe wildfire .",
            "The Department of Interior , which includes the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service , did not respond to written questions from AP .",
            "`` These agencies are still lagging far behind on these projects , '' said Susan Jane Brown , an attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center .",
            "Federal officials acknowledge their longstanding policy of putting out fires as quickly as possible , instead of letting some take their natural course , made forests overgrown and less able to cope with drought and disease .",
            "A Forest Service study this month found that about one-third of trees in areas where excessive vegetation had not been removed died between 2014 and 2018 .",
            "In thinned out places , the tree mortality rate was 11 % .",
            "Some treated areas had been subjected to `` prescribed '' burns -- fires intentionally set and carefully monitored .",
            "In its statement , the agency said it now uses prescribed fire on about 2,187 square miles ( 5,664 square kilometers ) of national forest land each year and plans to do more .",
            "But it said the practices `` has its challenges , '' including smoke pollution in nearby communities and a minor risk of losing control .",
            "Those burns -- along with other fuel reduction measures -- also are costly , requiring gear , materials and skilled personnel .",
            "Yet the Forest Service has fewer staffers to devote to them , while hiring thousands more people to extinguish fires that have grown bigger and more numerous .",
            "The service lost 7,000 non-firefighter positions between 1998 and 2015 .",
            "The share of its budget devoted to firefighting has shot up from 16 % in the mid-1990s to more than 50 % today and is expected to keep rising as the agency buys more helicopters , fire engines and other equipment .",
            "Shifting resources from forest treatment to firefighting does n't bode well for long-term prevention , said John Bailey , an Oregon State University forestry professor who worked with federal officials on a fire management strategy released in 2014 .",
            "It emphasized fuel reduction efforts , from clearing forest debris to rangeland grazing .",
            "`` We 're on a trajectory where fire seasons are going to get longer and drier and resources stretched thinner , '' he said .",
            "`` We 're just not making the progress we need to . ''",

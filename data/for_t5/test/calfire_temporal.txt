As the death toll from the wildfires that have charred millions of acres and created apocalyptic scenes across the West continues to climb , forecasters say that a pattern change is imminent -- but it might not be good news for all . Over 4.6 million acres of land are actively burning across the West , with most of these blazes ongoing in California , Washington and Oregon , according to the National Interagency Fire Center . Many of these blazes exploded in size during a high wind event around the Labor Day holiday .  At least 35 people have been killed along the West coast as a result of the blazes , and <extra_id_99> tens of thousands have been forced to evacuate , according to The Associated Press . The amount of smoke being emitted by the blazes has led to extremely unhealthy air quality from Seattle to San Francisco and points inland .

CALISTOGA , Calif. ( Reuters ) - California firefighters coping with limited resources and worsening weather struggled for a fifth day on Thursday to subdue flames menacing the famed Napa Valley wine region , while major progress was reported against a separate , deadly blaze in the Cascades .  The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -LRB- Cal Fire -RRB- said more than 17,000 fire personnel remained on the front lines of two dozen major wildfires across the state , with over <extra_id_99> 96,000 residents under evacuation orders . Roughly half of those evacuees have been displaced by a fast-spreading blaze dubbed the Glass Fire , which erupted on Sunday near the Napa Valley resort of Calistoga , some 75 miles ( 120 km ) north of San Francisco , then spread into neighboring Sonoma County . After a brief respite from fierce gusts that had fanned early growth of the blaze , fire crews on Thursday faced a return of strong winds , combined with above-normal heat and very low humidity , prompting red-flag warnings of heightened wildfire risks . The incendiary weather , supercharging fuel beds overgrown with tinder-dry grass and scrub , is expected to challenge firefighters through the weekend as they battle to defend Napa Valley 's homes and wineries in the midst of its harvest season .  title: California wine country firefight intensifies, progress made in deadly Cascades blaze dct: Thursday, Oct 01 2020, 18:55:33	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-10-01 </s>	People impacted (positively/negatively)
`` It 's a great example of climate change as a kind of an accelerant , '' says Michael Wara with Stanford 's Woods Institute for the Environment . `` This is a problem that 's been building gradually for decades . But what is happening this decade is the problem has kind of turned from this thing that we can manage to a monster .

The problem is simply too big for states to solve on their own , especially since the federal government owns the vast majority of public lands in the West , not the states . `` Coming up with the money to do this at scale has always been a major obstacle , '' Wara says . `` We need sustained federal and state financial support if we 're going to have any hope of moving the needle and bring good fire back into the landscape in a way that will be big enough to actually make a difference .

At least 10 deaths have been confirmed by the state medical examiner , and the total is likely to increase as search teams begin work in some of the communities devastated by the fires . Brown did not mention it during her daily briefing , but she put lawmakers on notice she may invoke line-item vetoes to save a net $ 65 million that could be spent on firefighting and related costs . The Aug. 10 special session of the Legislature cut spending for most agencies -- including the Department of Forestry , the Oregon National Guard and the Oregon State Police , all on the front lines of wildfire fighting -- but also set aside money for potential caseload increases in the Department of Human Services and the Oregon Health Authority .  She also urged the Emergency Board , which meets between legislative sessions , to set aside at least $ <extra_id_99> 150 million for firefighting costs . No date has been set for that meeting , but legislative committee hearings are scheduled Sept. 21-23 , so it will be sometime then . The state emergency fund , as a result of action by the special session , has a record $ 200 million . Other funds subject to board control are not available yet , but would revert to the emergency fund if they are not spent by Nov. 1 .  title: Brown and Wyden: Planning for wildfire recovery starts now dct: Tuesday, Sep 15 2020, 16:30:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-09-15 </s>	Items impacted (positively/negatively)
Mount Wilson Observatory The historic Mount Wilson Observatory is home to a well-known 60-inch telescope , which is now the world 's largest telescope entirely devoted to public viewing .

These fires can be particularly destructive in areas where forests are unhealthy , unmanaged and unnaturally dense . For those interested in taking action , but who have lacked the means , funding is now available to help address this risk .

Approximately $ <extra_id_99> 700,000 in total funding is available , and grant awards are available up to $ 250,000 . The Forest Restoration and Wildfire Risk Mitigation Grant Program helps fund projects that strategically reduce the potential wildfire risk to property , infrastructure and water supplies and that promote forest health through scientifically based forestry practices . The competitive grant program is designed to reduce risk to people and property in the wildland-urban interface and support long-term ecological restoration . Applications must not only promote forest health and address the reduction of hazardous fuels that could fuel a wildfire -- such as trees and brush near homes -- but also utilize wood products derived from forest management efforts .  title: Funding available for projects addressing forest health, wildfire risk dct: Thursday, Nov 19 2020, 16:50:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-11-19 </s>	Resources

It would be exorbitantly expensive to build enough power plants to ensure the electricity never goes off -- and some of those plants might sit idle for years at a time . So instead , the U.S. utility industry has long followed a standard of having enough power on call to ensure this type of outage does n't happen more than once every 10 years . The last time California was forced to implement rotating blackouts because of insufficient energy supply was nearly 20 years ago , during the 2001 energy crisis , as opposed to more recent intentional outages because of fire safety .  But these blackouts may strike a raw nerve for many PG&E customers after the utility 's decision last year to shut down power to <extra_id_99> millions of people in an effort to prevent its aging and poorly maintained transmission lines from igniting wildfires .

BOISE , Idaho ( AP ) -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often they are used while crews fight wildfires . `` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday . `` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate . ''  Still , the shelters have saved more than <extra_id_99> 300 firefighters since they began being used in the 1960s and became required in firefighting equipment in the late 1970s , Bilbao said . They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds ( 2 kilograms ) and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees ( 1,090 Celsius ) of heat for about a minute . The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure . The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said .  title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives, in some conditions dct: Wednesday, Sep 09 2020, 17:53:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-09-09 </s>	People impacted (positively/negatively)

The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said .

Scientists say climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable . Traditionally October and November are the worst months for fires , but already this year California has seen more than 8,600 wildfires that have scorched a record 6,400 square miles ( 16,576 square kilometers ) and destroyed about 9,200 homes , businesses and other structures . There have been 31 deaths .  Four of the <extra_id_99> five largest fires in state history occurred since mid-August , when a massive series of lightning strikes sparked hundreds of fires . All of the largest fires have been fully or significantly contained .

SAN FRANCISCO -- ( AP ) -- Northern California officials urged residents to leave homes in the hills , secure backyard furniture and other loose items and have an evacuation plan ready ahead of powerful winds that could lead to widespread electricity outages and leave more than 1 million people in the dark . Pacific Gas & Electric said it could black out customers starting Sunday in 38 counties to prevent the chance of sparking wildfires as bone-dry , windy weather returns to the region . In the San Francisco Bay Area , some customers in every county except for San Francisco could see their power shut off .

Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday that 42 wildfires had erupted over the 24 hours that ended Tuesday morning .

Andrew Whelton , an associate professor of civil , environmental and ecological engineering at Purdue University , said such contamination is gaining more attention -- and scrutiny -- given the lack of water testing after wildfires . `` We do n't know if this has happened prior to 2017 because , as it turns out , states and municipalities and first responders did n't test drinking water systems that have been struck by fire for that type of contamination , '' said Whelton .

Kean is <extra_id_99> one of three full-time employees in Colorado working with other federal partners from the Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to assess such post-fire hazards . He and his colleagues generate hazard maps showing which drainage basins are most susceptible to debris flows , as well as estimates for how much rain it would take to trigger those flows , levels called `` rainfall thresholds . '' The National Weather Service then uses those readings when watching the rains in the winter to alert residents when to prepare to evacuate or issue warnings , he said .

The region is known for having `` alluvial fans , '' slopes created over long periods of time that start at a narrow point and spread into the shape of an upside-down fan or ice cream cone . A task force that analyzed the Thomas Fire found that debris flows are a common characteristic of alluvial fans ( Greenwire , Jan. 22 ) . And the same explosive conditions that can trigger mudslides and debris flows can also unearth or move contaminants into nearby rivers and streams -- from charred industrial sites , cars and homes , or even former mining sites where fire and then water strip away soil and vegetation keeping metals or other materials in place .  One USGS study found that <extra_id_99> a wildfire in 2010 near Boulder , Colo. , that had burned a forested watershed had also changed the soil 's hydrology and mobilized arsenic and metals from legacy mining sites in the area , creating a risk to water supplies . Sheila Murphy , a hydrologist at USGS who co-authored the study , said that unlike a chemical spill that causes an immediate impact on water quality , effects of a wildfire may take months or even years to become evident . `` There 's a lot of focus on the fire when it 's happening , like ` My gosh , these homes are burning ; these buildings are damaged .

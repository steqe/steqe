`` I think it 's been an astonishing year , an astonishing summer , for a massive increase in anger at police all over the world , '' Lawrence Sherman , criminologist and director of Cambridge University 's Center for Evidence Based Policing , told ABC News . Yet , in terms of scale , tactics and accountability measures , police violence in the U.S. is `` enormously different '' than in other advanced democracies , according to Sherman . Police in the U.S. , by far , kill more civilians per year than other wealthy democracies , according to data compiled by the Prison Policy initiative .  Last year , <extra_id_99> 1,099 people were killed in confrontations with the police in the U.S. , a rate of 33.5 citizens per 10 million per year ; the next highest countries were Canada with 36 deaths -LRB- 9.8 citizens per 10 million -RRB- and Australia with 21 -LRB- 8.5 citizens per 10 million -RRB- . In England and Wales -- the scenes of some of the largest Black Lives Matter protests outside the U.S. this summer -- only three people were killed in police shootings last year , a rate of 0.5 citizens per 10 million . Crucial to that disparity , according to Sherman , is not just the fact that many other national police are not armed -- but that the populations are n't either . There are an estimated 270 million civilian firearms in the U.S. , which amounts to 89 firearms per 100 residents , according to the Small Arms Survey .  title: Death of George Floyd prompts reckoning over race, colonialism in Europe	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_11>

She also said she does n't believe the 4th of July holiday represents everyone . `` Independence Day does not truly represent African Americans because after the war African Americans were still in slavery , '' Cooke said . `` For us to sit here and continue to protest and fight for our rights and demand justice on this holiday that is not really for us , is just us letting them know we 're not going anywhere and we 're not going to stop until we get justice .

Thus , I had a voter registration booth at the rally . I firmly believe that this change is achieved when concerned citizens , especially youth who feel disenfranchised by a system they see as broken , vote for candidates that will fight for progress , and in this case , progress towards ending racial subjugation in the United States . That is why I also had elected officials and political candidates come to my rally so that not only could they use that platform to encourage people to continue in this fight to end police brutality , but also so that these disenfranchised youth could ask these officials what they have done to fix a broken system .  During the rally , when I marched with approximately <extra_id_99> 70 fellow El Pasoans to the El Paso police headquarters , I was encouraged by the young passionate faces yearning for universal equality .

Black Americans flock to the polls in historic numbers . The death of George Floyd this May set into course a historic summer of protest for the Black Lives Matter movement , with millions of Americans marching in towns and cities across the country in protest of racial discrimination and police brutality . Both the demonstrations and their coverage were intensely polarizing , and despite most Black Lives Matter protests having been overwhelmingly nonviolent , some violence and property destruction took place , and law enforcement in many areas responded with force .  Tens of thousands of demonstrators and activists were arrested , and <extra_id_99> hundreds hit with more serious charges by federal and local prosecutors . According to a Washington Post review of data on more than 2,600 people detained in 15 cities , those arrested over the course of the past five months were `` a diverse , young group of people who demonstrated close to home and were charged largely with nonviolent crimes . '' A country divided With the presidential election just a few days away , it 's difficult to fathom the events Americans have endured this year but equally impossible to negate the progress that has been made .

Video shared widely on social media shows law enforcement officials thanking militia members , including Rittenhouse , for being in the streets on Aug. 25 , despite the curfew being in effect .

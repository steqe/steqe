``` Pull yourself up by your bootstraps ' is probably the most misleading statement ever , '' says Colorado Department of Human Services Office of Behavioral Health chief Robert Werthwein , noting the credo wrongly assumes mental health hinges solely on individual will rather than on genetics , brain chemistry , trauma and other factors .

Only one in three U.S. adults received the flu vaccine in 2018 , a number that has critical implications for the impending flu season , which threatens to overwhelm medical resources and lead to tens of thousands of deaths at a time when Americans are still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic . A new study led by researchers at UC San Francisco has uncovered demographics of those groups who are less likely to receive the flu shot . These findings may inform public health efforts for future COVID-19 vaccines , and raise questions about making both flu and COVID vaccines free of charge and mandatory .  In the study , which publishes in the Journal of General Internal Medicine on Aug. 26 , 2020 , the researchers evaluated self-reported flu vaccination rates for 2018 , which included data from the 2017 -- 18 flu season -LRB- 61,000 deaths -RRB- and 2018 -- 19 season -LRB- <extra_id_99> 34,200 deaths -RRB- . The data was recorded in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System , an annual national survey of 400,000-plus U.S. adults , conducted by state health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` To achieve herd immunity , we would need to reach about an 80 percent vaccination rate , but no subgroup in our study exceeded 60 percent , '' said senior author R.

The new data , which is similar to that released by other states , shows that Black Louisianans have been roughly three times as likely to contract the coronavirus as their White counterparts , a massive difference that by itself may explain the disparity in death rates . In fact , according to the data , once infected , White Louisianans have been more likely to die than Black Louisianans -- a mystery that has yet to be untangled but could be explained in part by the heavier concentration of White people in the state 's nursing homes , where more than 40 % of Louisiana deaths have occurred . The data on infection rates , like all coronavirus statistics , come with caveats , as an analysis by the Public Affairs Research Council noted .  A big one is that the race of the person testing positive is listed as `` unknown '' or `` other '' in more than <extra_id_99> 1 of every 4 Louisiana cases , making the data much less precise than the state 's death figures . And , of course , the tests only track known cases , which are likely a fraction of actual cases . It 's possible , too , that White and Black people get tested at different rates , which would affect the results . Even with those caveats , the differences in the infection rates are so stark -- with Black infection rates three times those of Whites -- that they appear to be the key link in the puzzle .  title: Why infection rate might be key to coronavirus's disproportionate impact on Black people dct: Saturday, Jul 18 2020, 23:30:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown unknown </s>	Infections: confirmed or tested positive for COVID-19

Laura Kelly is expressing expressed little concern over a smaller-than-expected second shipment of a coronavirus vaccine for Kansas , adding that she expects the state 's plan for distributing shots in coming months to boost the economy . Kelly said the reduction in the state 's second shipment of a vaccine made by Pfizer is `` more of a smoothing process '' by the federal government to make sure health care workers who received the first of two doses this week can get the second in January . At least a dozen states have reported that they will receive fewer doses next week than anticipated .  The governor 's comments came as the state Department of Health and Environment reported that Kansas has surpassed <extra_id_99> 200,000 confirmed and probable coronavirus cases for the pandemic , or about one for every 15 of its 2.9 million residents .

It 's here -- the new coronavirus -- and Houstonians are n't sure just how nervous to be . Five people had tested positive in Harris County and three more had done so in Fort Bend County as of late Friday , bringing concerns about the virus closer to home than ever before . All eight had been exposed to the virus in Egypt , on the same trip .  In other words , we 're now confronting a scary new virus that has spread to more than <extra_id_99> 65 countries since emerging in China late last year and that 's led to the treatment of more than 300 patients across the United States , 15 of whom had died as of Friday . Dr Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told Congress this week that the outbreak will likely be deemed a global pandemic by the World Health Organization -- and epidemiologists have said that a majority of the world 's population could be infected eventually . So it was therefore predictable that the so-called `` coronavirus disease 2019 , '' or COVID-2019 , would eventually come to the densely populated and highly globalized Houston area . And now that it has , it 's unclear what we can do on an individual basis other than following the now-familiar advice from public health officials : wash hands frequently , for example , and avoid touching one 's face .  title: Sudden arrival of coronavirus provides a wake-up call for Houstonians	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_10>

Erb said infection control is `` not a new issue '' for nursing homes , which regularly have increased monitoring and cleaning during outbreaks of influenza . Of the 75 outbreaks of influenza in Maine this season , 43 were reported at long-term care facilities , the Maine CDC said . At The Cedars in Portland , screening began on Wednesday .  The Cedars -- which includes skilled nursing for 102 patients , 61 independent-living apartments and <extra_id_99> 30 assisted -- living apartments -- has also canceled community events with more than 20 people , increased sanitizing of high-touch areas and will consider limiting visitors if needed , said Katharine O'Neill , director of housing and communications at The Cedars . `` We 're taking it a day at a time , '' she said . Erb said he is anticipating there will be a shortage of medical supplies available to nursing homes as the pandemic continues and that some are already hard to come by . Staff at The Cedars stocked up on face masks and hand-sanitizer , but have been told by distributors it could be months before those supplies are available again .  title: Maine nursing homes on high alert during coronavirus pandemic	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_10>
But the potential magnitude of the impacts of the new coronavirus and its rate of progression based on what is happening around the world , in New York and in Washington state call for local leaders to do more and to establish more specific guidelines and expectations . Even small delays in implementing more stringent measures will amplify the looming medical challenges in the days and weeks ahead . The rapid escalation of the problem in Italy , which on Feb. 21 had 17 cases and on Wednesday was reporting 12,462 cases in spite of imposing extreme restrictions unthinkable just days ago , is a warning to us of where we might be in another three weeks .  To its credit , Santa Clara County , with 48 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Wednesday , including at least 21 community spread cases and <extra_id_99> one death , became the first in the country earlier this week to take an obvious but bold first step to ban any gathering of more than 1,000 people . But now , just days later , that order seems grossly inadequate . New developments , which include increasing appeals by health officials and the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization , are happening so rapidly that official guidance to the public ca n't keep up .

It 's not yet clear how long it will last . Just two days earlier , San Francisco banned all non-essential events of 1,000 people or more . But the rapid spread of the virus has led city health officials to further discourage large congregations of people , which can act as breeding grounds for the highly contagious virus .  Spaces like hospitals , grocery stores and transit terminals are expected to be exempt from the prohibition , as they were with the previous order restricting gatherings of <extra_id_99> 1,000 people or more . Other essential services , like food banks , will also be allowed to stay open . Gov. Gavin Newsom urged Californians to cancel or avoid all large gatherings until the end of the month , and the state 's public health department recommended that events be limited to no more than 250 people and should not proceed at all unless organizers could ensure at least 6 feet of distance between attendees .  title: San Francisco to ban public gatherings of 250 more people in wake of coronavirus spreading	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_10>

To understand how hospital capacity could vary region to region during the pandemic , ProPublica used data that was modeled by Dr. Ashish Jha and his team of researchers from the Harvard Global Health Institute . What data was used to create the models ? For the analysis , Jha and his team looked at various scenarios , in which 20 percent , 40 percent and 60 percent of the adult population would be infected with the virus , many of whom would have no or few symptoms .  They then examined whether hospitals had the capacity to handle those <extra_id_99> three scenarios if the cases came in over six months , 12 months and 18 months . Hospital bed figures were derived from recent surveys conducted by the American Hospital Association and data compiled by the American Hospital Directory . The researchers divided the country into slightly more than 300 regions , also known as hospital referral regions , a technique that is common in health policy research . In most scenarios , `` vast communities in America are not prepared to take care of the COVID-19 patients showing up , '' Jha told ProPublica .  title: Report: Region lacks enough hospital beds for virus spike	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_10>
Still , he said , the agencies have discussed alternate response plans in case call volume spikes or a significant portion of first responders get sick .

The <extra_id_99> two-person team would n't take a vehicle used for transporting patients -- thus keeping those vehicles , such as ambulances , available for when a person needs to be taken to a hospital .

Mayor Bill de Blasio : We have immense capacity ... New York City hospitals have 1,200 beds on reserve for potential COVID-19 patients that wo n't compromise other healthcare services . Dr. Mitchell Katz , CEO of NYC Health + Hospitals : We have 11 acute care hospitals , five nursing facilities and 60 outpatient care sites .

Hospital staff said the first step is to question a patient , who has been out of the country or exposed to someone with COVID-19 . If they think that a person could have the virus , doctors will place the patient in a negative pressure isolation room . Once the patient is isolated , the hospital 's infectious disease team will contact DHEC and the CDC .  Right now , only those two agencies have the ability to test for COVID-19 in South Carolina , and they also help the hospital decide whether or not <extra_id_99> a patient should be tested . Hospitals in the state still do not have access to the testing kits . `` Right now , this is the early steps with the CDC , explained Dr. Steve Shelton , an Emergency Physician at Prisma Health Richland Hospital . `` They are sending them out to public agencies and are starting to make materials available for private manufacturers , so hopefully we will eventually have it within our laboratories .

The staffing stars make up one component of the overall rating . `` So many times , when there are n't enough staff , the aides and nurses are literally trying to do 50 things at once , running from person to person , '' said Lori Smetanka , executive director of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care , a nonprofit based in Washington , D.C. `` That 's when things fall through the cracks , like handwashing , which is the most useful thing to do to prevent infections . '' More sparsely staffed nursing homes were also cited more often : one-star facilities averaged 1.5 deficiencies while five-star facilities averaged 1.3 deficiencies .  But out of more than <extra_id_99> 13,000 citations for infection-control lapses , regulators classified only 109 as serious harms or threats to patients . That finding echoed the results of a similar investigation KHN conducted in 2017 . `` It shows how ineffectual the enforcement situation is , '' said Toby Edelman , a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy . One such violation was cited last April at the Kirkland nursing home after inspectors there observed a registered nurse treating a patient whose feet were touching the floor , even though one heel had a pressure sore that the resident 's daughter said she feared was infected .  title: Before Coronavirus Outbreak, Many Nursing Homes Had Infection-Control Lapses	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_10>

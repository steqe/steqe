But along with that , protesters like Mane said they 've found taking to the streets can be all the more empowering . Where public protest and pedestrian safety intersect On June 3 , a protest outside Cincinnati City Hall became the stage where the long-standing drama between Cincinnatians on foot and those behind the wheel played out . Demonstrators formed a line in and behind the crosswalk spanning Plum Street at Ninth Street -- blocking traffic -- when surveillance video showed that , while nearly every driver detoured around the crowd , one motorist appeared insistent on trying to move his vehicle through the line of protesters .  The incident unfolded in less than 30 seconds : The video shows <extra_id_99> one protester moving out of the way less than a second before the driver would have struck her with his BMW . After another man stepped in front of the car -- in an apparent attempt to stop it -- demonstrators then began to gather around the vehicle 's hood .

Far-right counterprotesters , on the other hand , are feeling greater pressure to maintain the status quo of a Trump presidency . Add local and federal officials calling in more police or the National Guard as a solution , and tensions only rise . The chaos could result in more division and deaths , taking the focus off one of the largest civil rights movement in history and its mission to seek justice for Black lives .  Why clashes are on the rise and in the headlines A new report from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project , in collaboration with Princeton University 's Bridging Divides Initiative , identified <extra_id_99> 7,750 Black Lives Matter protests from May 26 through August 22 at 2,400 locations across the US . An examination of these events found that 93 percent of them remained peaceful while protests at about 220 locations turned `` violent '' -- defined as the destruction of property , and including clashes between protesters and police and counterprotesters . The report also found that in these places the violence was restricted to specific blocks of the city and not widespread . Yet , despite the fact that protests remained largely peaceful over the course of about four months , the report warned that a hyper-polarized environment spurred by state forces that take `` a more heavy-handed approach to dissent '' will only make non-state actors `` more active and assertive , '' and that counterdemonstrators will `` resolve their political disputes in the street '' ahead of the election .  title: Why some counterprotests to Black Lives Matter are turning violent dct: Monday, Sep 14 2020, 15:50:00	answer: <extra_id_99> 2020-05-26 2020-08-22 </s>	Number of protests or relevant activities -- Happened or planned to happen

Denver 's emergency curfew will be allowed to expire Friday as protests continue with fewer cases of vandalism and aggression , city officials said .  Although police arrested <extra_id_99> hundreds over the past week on charges of curfew violations , assault , criminal mischief , burglary , arson and more , in recent days the arrests have dwindled and a sort of truce appears to have been cemented between demonstrators and police .

Karwan Fatah-Black , a historian and lecturer at Leiden University , thinks the many protests in the Netherlands in the wake of Floyd 's death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25 are a response to the voices of migrants and descendants of people from former Dutch colonies being marginalized in Dutch society . `` Their concerns were always brushed aside for a very long time , '' Fatah-Black said . Among the concerns he listed : Racial profiling by police and tax authorities , discrimination in workplaces , schools and on the housing rental market , and cases of police brutality .  The demonstration , set to take place in Coen 's hometown of Hoorn , follows protests across the Netherlands in recent weeks against police violence and racism , including two in Amsterdam that drew <extra_id_99> thousands of participants . A statue of Piet Hein , a colonial era mariner widely regarded as a hero , was daubed with red paint and the word `` killer '' last week . Prof. Remco Raben , who teaches Dutch colonial and post-colonial history at the University of Amsterdam , said the protests targeting statues are `` a kind of correction of the vision of the nation as it emerged in the 19th century and not as a rewriting of the history . It 's the rewriting of the image of the nation .

The use of `` less than lethal force '' such as rubber bullets and tear gas against peaceful protesters -- some of whom are teenagers and children -- is unnecessarily terrible in itself , but aggression against reporters and legal observers is an act against freedom of the press . The President insists that the violence is the fault of the protesters who smashed windows and looted buildings in June . Interestingly , he conveniently ignores the fact that those people , by video documentation and admissions , were proven to actually be undercover cops and white supremacists hijacking the true purpose of the movement -- to give a voice to those who demand justice .  In spite of , or perhaps in sympathy with , a disastrously ignorant and racist President , state governments have been slow to respond to and act on the demands of the <extra_id_99> hundreds of thousands of protesters , leaving the budgets of police departments as overinflated as usual and keeping qualified immunity for the officers in place . However , some states like Colorado have taken appropriate measures to begin the reconstruction of the inherently racist police systems , such as passing a bill to end qualified immunity in relation to state constitutional claims , according to Forbes . Other states like Virginia have bills being considered to do the same , and to end no-knock police raids -- one of which caused the senseless and horrific murder of 26-year-old EMT Breonna Taylor , while she slept in her home , in March .

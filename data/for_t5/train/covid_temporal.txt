Coronavirus misperceptions : Underestimation of COVID-19 's impact may lead to inflated belief in one 's ability to avoid infection .

`` It has been put on a lower-level of priority , if you will , because of the interest in getting the case numbers , the testing and the contact tracing that 's needed to respond and get the desired results , '' Levine said . The CDC did not respond to questions about what it considers a `` recovered '' case to be , what role recovery data should play during the pandemic and whether it recommends if states should track recovery data . Instead , it sent a written statement reminding the public that it 's still unknown if COVID-19 antibodies provide immunity to the disease and that CDC scientists are `` currently conducting studies to answer these questions .

But with each state having the option to track and define recovery cases , this `` lack of clarity '' makes the metric `` useless , '' said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health . For Nuzzo , hospitalizations , daily new cases , testing and the positive test rate are more important than recovery counts . So are `` active '' cases -- how many people are confirmed to be ill with the disease and are believed to be contagious -- and how many contacts of confirmed cases are being monitored and have been successfully traced and isolated .  title: How many people have recovered from coronavirus in Florida?

Arnold 's son had seen signs that could reflect a shortage of workers . He did n't think the facility was as clean as it should be , and once , he says , he walked straight to his mother 's room without encountering any staff . Then , when the pandemic hit , Wildwood lost workers to the virus even as it made what officials described as heroic efforts to maintain staffing and care for the residents .  Arnold is among 21 residents of the Indianapolis facility to die of COVID-19 out of <extra_id_99> 173 who were infected , the second-highest caseload in the state . Like Wildwood , 67 % of the other Hoosier homes reporting 50 or more resident coronavirus cases also had below-average staffing ratings of one or two stars , an examination of federal records show . That could have placed patients particularly at risk during the pandemic at the 49 facilities . A federal government watchdog agency reported this month that nursing homes without enough nurses and caregivers can struggle to respond to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 .  title: Staffing shortages compound COVID-19 infections, deaths dct: Saturday, Aug 15 2020, 06:00:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-08-15 </s>	Infections: confirmed or tested positive for COVID-19
Greg Abbott said . The number of coronavirus tests being done each day in Texas has dropped by the thousands in August , mirroring nationwide trends that has seen daily testing averages in the U.S. fall nearly 9 % since the end of July , according to The COVID Tracking Project . The problem is dwindling demand : Testing centers like CentroMed are no longer inundated by long lines that stretch for blocks , or closing hours early because tests run out .  The dropoff comes as the U.S. has surpassed <extra_id_99> 5 million confirmed coronavirus cases and is closing in on 170,000 deaths . It threatens to put the U.S. even further behind other countries that have better managed the pandemic , in part , through more aggressive testing . The trend worries health experts who fear that Texas risks flying blind into the fall if it does n't increase testing . Texas embarked on one of the fastest reopenings in the U.S. in May but retreated weeks later in the face of massive outbreaks , ultimately leading Abbott to impose a statewide mask order after previously saying he would n't .  title: Testing rates in Texas drop as schools reopen and football teams break the huddle dct: Saturday, Aug 15 2020, 14:32:52	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-08-15 </s>	Infections: confirmed or tested positive for COVID-19

`` The expected increase in hospitalizations , assuming the increase in ( transmission rates ) continues ... suggest that we are at risk of running out of hospital beds if we do n't take steps to increase that capacity within the next two to three weeks , '' Lewis said . He stressed that many of the people who will need those beds in coming weeks `` are people who have already been exposed .

In Los Angeles County , <extra_id_99> one in every 140 people is infected with COVID-19 and capable of spreading it to others , likely without having any symptoms or even knowing they are carrying the virus , according to Lewis . That figure has dramatically changed from last week , when the estimate was one in every 400 people . `` What this means is that Angelenos in the activities of daily living when they go out are very likely to be in the locations or near persons who are currently infectious , and in fact a large typical store is likely to have multiple infectious persons enter the shop every day , '' Dr. Roger Lewis , who leads the county 's statistical modeling efforts , said .

Colorado Health Care Association CEO Doug Farmer said long-term care facilities are doing better now than in the spring , because they have more consistent access to personal protective equipment and testing . But still argued general community control of the spread will give those facilities a better chance . `` The risk there is primarily through staff who may be exposed in the community and then unknowingly -- because oftentimes this infection , unfortunately , is asymptomatic , so we do n't have any signs to notice to stay home -- those workers could potentially introduce that virus into a facility , '' state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said .  New outbreaks surged in November , with <extra_id_99> 958 active clusters reported as of Wednesday , an increase of 223 compared to a week earlier , health officials said .

The two long-term care facilities are among 15 in Johnson County collectively reporting 114 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 24 , the department said . Just three of those facilities -- Forest Creek , Brighton Gardens and Stratford Commons in Overland Park , which reported 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases and three deaths -- accounted for 57 % of all the cases and half the 26 deaths . The 114 long-term care cases themselves account for 26 % of the 439 confirmed cases throughout Johnson County .  And the <extra_id_99> 26 deaths make up 66 % of the 39 COVID-19 deaths countywide . The disproportionate number of cases and deaths in long-term care facilities underscores the susceptibility of their residents , who are older and tend to have high levels of chronic illness , to the coronavirus . In nursing homes especially , residents typically live in close quarters and caregivers move from room to room , making it difficult to contain the spread of infections . Nearly one in 10 nursing homes nationwide have reported COVID-19 cases , according to an analysis by the Washington Post , which said that figure probably vastly understates the number because many states have not released the names of facilities with cases of the virus .  title: 3 Facilities Account For Half Of The COVID-19 Deaths At Johnson County's Long-Term Care Centers dct: Monday, Apr 27 2020, 15:24:20	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-04-27 </s>	Deaths: definitely caused by COVID-19

Journalist Patrick Cockburn ( Independent , 1/24/20 ) observed that the need to blame somebody , the spread of misinformation and suspicion of assurances provided by authorities , are common features of epidemics , because it 's difficult for governments to convey a sense of calm and emergency at the same time . Corporate media provide relentless reports on new outbreak and mortality figures without providing comparisons to other common diseases and previous epidemics , with headlines like the Washington Post 's `` South Korea Coronavirus Cases Surge as Italy Confirms First Death From the Virus '' ( 2/21/20 ) , the New York Times ' `` Deaths in China Surpass Toll From SARS '' ( 2/9/20 ) and USA Today 's `` Death Toll From Coronavirus Surpasses 1,100 ; US Confirms 13th Case '' ( 2/19/20 ) . Virtually all of these kinds of reports include comparisons with previous epidemics surfacing in China , like SARS , but scrupulously avoid making comparisons with more familiar -- and devastating -- diseases like influenza , and epidemics originating in the US like the H1N1 swine flu .  For example , when Business Insider ( 3/6/20 ) reported that there are over <extra_id_99> 100,000 cases of people infected with the coronavirus , with over 3,400 fatalities worldwide , it omitted that the flu infects and kills far more people every year . Although it 's true that the coronavirus has a higher fatality rate ( about 0.1 % , compared to coronavirus ' 3.4 % ) , it 's also true that the flu is much more infectious and kills far more people . In the winter of 2017 -- 18 for the US alone , a worse than usual year , it 's estimated that the flu killed 80,000 . So far in the 2019 -- 20 season , there have been at least 32 million to 45 million flu infections in the US , and 18,000 to 46,000 deaths .  title: Coronavirus Alarm Blends Yellow Peril and Red Scare dct: Friday, Mar 06 2020, 12:44:27	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-03-06 </s>	Infections: confirmed or tested positive for COVID-19

`` We 've pretty much dismantled this place and put ourselves on war footings , '' said Rutland Regional President Claudio Fort , who leads the state 's second largest hospital after the University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington . Rutland treats an average of 87 patients but could house as many as 132 with current staff , or 162 with outside help , and 195 with cots in public areas such as its conference center , Fort said . Rutland also has set up Castleton University 's nearby Spartan Arena to hold up to 150 cots , either for low-acuity non-Covid-19 patients or , in a worst case scenario , more with the disease .  Rutland has housed four coronavirus patients over the past week -- <extra_id_99> three on ventilators -- while its current overall census of around 60 totals only about two-thirds its normal number . `` It seems things have stabilized , but it 's still too early to tell , '' said Fort , who continues to promote measures to prevent the spread of the virus including staying home and physical distancing . Rutland 's biggest challenge so far is having to furlough about 150 of its 1,700 workers because of the curtailment of elective procedures . `` Our revenues are down by 60 % , '' Fort said .  title: Southern Vermont hub hospitals prepare Covid-19 surge sites dct: Wednesday, Apr 08 2020, 16:08:56	answer: <extra_id_99> 2020-04-01 2020-04-08 </s>	Patients with COVID-19: on ventilators
That has cut revenue by about 80 % and led to furloughs for about 10 % of its 600 employees .

That 's helped the MTA keep up with its big-ticket transit projects , including the massive East Side Access project to bring Long Island Rail Road service to Grand Central Terminal and the ongoing effort to overhaul the subway 's outdated , delay-inducing signaling system . Workers at MTA job sites must receive a regular temperature check and refrain from sharing tools or tight spaces .

`` Even before Covid , we 're on high alert for suspicion of clots in the ICU because they 're at high risk , '' Gong said .

A study of <extra_id_99> 81 similarly ill patients in Wuhan , China , found a 25 % incidence of clots . Dr. Behnood Bikdeli , who helped coordinate the international coalition of physicians looking into the clotting issue , called those numbers `` alarming .

One is that vast majority of patients who become severely ill with coronavirus have underlying medical problems , such as diabetes , heart disease and high blood pressure .  title: Doctors Try To Untangle Why They’re Seeing ‘Unprecedented’ Blood Clotting Among COVID-19 Patients dct: Wednesday, Apr 22 2020, 06:25:16	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-04-22 </s>	Patients with COVID-19: hospitalized

For the United States as a whole , the institute predicted that coronavirus infection would peak on April 14 , when the nationwide supply of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients would fall 50,000 short of the supply and the supply of intensive-care beds for such patients would fall shorty by nearly 15,000 .  Nationwide deaths on that date will top 2,300 , the institute predicted , and would total more than <extra_id_99> 81,000 by Aug. 4 . The authors of the research article containing these findings wrote , `` Our estimate of 81 thousand deaths in the US over the next 4 months is an alarming number , but this number could be substantially higher if excess demand for health system resources is not addressed and if social distancing policies are not vigorously implemented and enforced across all states . '' In New Hampshire , the institute projects the infection rate to peak on April 24 , when the number of beds available for coronavirus patients will fall nine short of the 1,027 needed , and the number of intensive-care beds will fall 73 short of the 156 needed . On that peak date , deaths are expected to total ten , and 318 New Hampshire residents could die by Aug. 4 , the institute said .  title: NH Coronavirus: 318 Deaths Projected By August dct: Saturday, Mar 28 2020, 14:28:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-08-04 </s>	Deaths: definitely caused by COVID-19

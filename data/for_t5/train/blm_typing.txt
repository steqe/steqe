Painting was supposed to take place last week , but had to be postponed for `` logistical '' reasons , de Balsio said during a press briefing before the July 4 weekend . The mayor personally pushed for plans to install a mural in front of President Donald Trump 's namesake Midtown skyscraper as part of an initiative to install Black Lives Matter murals throughout the city .  When asked last week why the city was moving forward with the mural despite a $ <extra_id_99> 9 billion budget shortfall , de Blasio described the mural as a `` small cost , big impact '' proposal . The mayor also admitted that the symbolic effort is simply a `` small measure '' to acknowledge and respect the contributions of Black people to New York City and the country as a whole . `` There is much more we have to do -- with our commission on racial justice and reconciliation we are going to look at the big things we have to do , the structural and institutional racism we have to address , '' de Blasio said . President Donald Trump took to twitter last week to condemn the city 's plans , likening the Black Lives Matter mural to a `` symbol of hate .

But along with that , protesters like Mane said they 've found taking to the streets can be all the more empowering . Where public protest and pedestrian safety intersect On June 3 , a protest outside Cincinnati City Hall became the stage where the long-standing drama between Cincinnatians on foot and those behind the wheel played out . Demonstrators formed a line in and behind the crosswalk spanning Plum Street at Ninth Street -- blocking traffic -- when surveillance video showed that , while nearly every driver detoured around the crowd , one motorist appeared insistent on trying to move his vehicle through the line of protesters .  The incident unfolded in less than 30 seconds : The video shows <extra_id_99> one protester moving out of the way less than a second before the driver would have struck her with his BMW . After another man stepped in front of the car -- in an apparent attempt to stop it -- demonstrators then began to gather around the vehicle 's hood . At that point the driver jolted the car forward twice , pushing some people out of its way . The driver then quickly reversed the vehicle and drove west on Ninth Street .  title: 'Whose streets?

Far-right counterprotesters , on the other hand , are feeling greater pressure to maintain the status quo of a Trump presidency . Add local and federal officials calling in more police or the National Guard as a solution , and tensions only rise . The chaos could result in more division and deaths , taking the focus off one of the largest civil rights movement in history and its mission to seek justice for Black lives .  Why clashes are on the rise and in the headlines A new report from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project , in collaboration with Princeton University 's Bridging Divides Initiative , identified <extra_id_99> 7,750 Black Lives Matter protests from May 26 through August 22 at 2,400 locations across the US . An examination of these events found that 93 percent of them remained peaceful while protests at about 220 locations turned `` violent '' -- defined as the destruction of property , and including clashes between protesters and police and counterprotesters . The report also found that in these places the violence was restricted to specific blocks of the city and not widespread . Yet , despite the fact that protests remained largely peaceful over the course of about four months , the report warned that a hyper-polarized environment spurred by state forces that take `` a more heavy-handed approach to dissent '' will only make non-state actors `` more active and assertive , '' and that counterdemonstrators will `` resolve their political disputes in the street '' ahead of the election .  title: Why some counterprotests to Black Lives Matter are turning violent	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

In Portland , for example , federal agents were sent to ostensibly keep the peace in July , but instead used excessive force and detained people in unmarked vehicles , only reescalating tensions . After the deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents in Portland , `` the percentage of violent demonstrations has risen from under 17 % to over 42 % , suggesting that the federal response has only aggravated unrest , '' the report states . Counterprotest activity is also on the rise , a trend that can quickly escalate the number of violent clashes , according to the report : Between 24 May and 22 August , over 360 counter-protests were recorded around the country , accounting for nearly 5 % of all demonstrations .  Of these , <extra_id_99> 43 -- nearly 12 % -- turned violent , with clashes between pro-police demonstrators and demonstrators associated with the BLM movement , for example .

On Sunday , Jadon Sancho showed how it can also be used to send a powerful message , revealing when he scored for Borussia Dortmund in their 6-1 win at Paderborn a second layer under his shirt with `` Justice for George Floyd '' underneath , a display of solidarity for Floyd , who died after he was held down by a police officer pressing a knee into his neck in Minneapolis last week .

Beyond those <extra_id_99> four words of togetherness , Sancho highlighted a significant flaw in Fifa 's rules .

Started by two black women music executives under the name The Show Must Be Paused , the industry-wide stoppage morphed into an excuse for major labels to essentially take a day off , offer vague platitudes , and in a few cases , point to causes worth donating . A number of streaming services have elected to `` go dark '' or insert moments of silence spanning 8 minutes and 46 seconds into their programming , to mirror the duration of time Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd 's neck . Spotify will be adding the moment of silence to a select number of playlists and podcasts , in addition to matching employee donations to organizations `` focused on the fight against racism ; injustice ; inequity , '' per a press release .  As a refresher , Spotify pays artists , songwriters , labels , and rights holders between $ <extra_id_99> 0.006 and $ 0.0084 per stream to divvy up . Quibi , a company that was pretty much in freefall on arrival , will also `` go dark '' for 8 minutes and 46 seconds on Tuesday to remember Floyd 's death . It 's unclear how a streaming service with on-demand content -- not streaming on a continuous 24 hour broadcast -- intends to impose this on viewers , which totaled just 1.3 million active users as of May 11 .

Black Lives Matter protests that have erupted across the United States may be the largest demonstrations in the country 's history , with upwards of 26million people participating .  The figures come from four recent polls - including one released by Civis Analytics - that found that <extra_id_99> 15 million people to 26 million people have been a part of demonstrations that spawned following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery , Breonna Taylor and George Floyd . ` I 've never seen self-reports of protest participation that high for a specific issue over such a short period , ' Neal Caren , associate professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , explained to the New York Times . The surveys suggest that at the minimum , seven million people participated in demonstrations over the last several weeks . In comparison , roughly three million to five million people came out for the Woman 's March of 2017 on a single day .  title: Black Lives Matter protests may be the largest in U.S. history as more than 26MILLION Americans have been at the more than 4,700 demonstrations around the country	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Civil rights marches in the 1960s were not nearly as big , the professor added . ` If we added up all those protests during that period , we 're talking about hundreds of thousands of people , but not millions , ' she said .

More than <extra_id_99> 4,700 demonstrations have happened in the United States since May 26 , averaging out to roughly 140 per day . ` The geographic spread of protest is a really important characteristic and helps signal the depth and breadth of a movement 's support , ' said Kenneth Andrews , a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Professor Woodly explained that the protests are taking place in such vast numbers because activists are gaining guidance and framework for their demonstrations from Black Lives Matter . There does appear to be some correlation in activism and disdain for Trump and his administration .  title: Black Lives Matter protests may be the largest in U.S. history as more than 26MILLION Americans have been at the more than 4,700 demonstrations around the country	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

Finra Orders SagePoint to Pay $ 1.6 M Over UIT Sales June 16 , 2020 Finra says it ordered Advisor Group broker-dealer SagePoint Financial to pay around $ 1.6 million over the sale of unit investment trusts . From January 2013 through December 2017 , the company allegedly failed to have in place an adequate supervisory system as well as written supervisory procedures that would properly supervise the suitability of its representatives ' recommendations of early rollovers of UITs , according to a letter of acceptance , waiver and consent published by the industry 's self-regulator . UITs typically terminate after 15 or 24 months and come with various upfront sales charges , so selling them before maturity and buying new UITs with the proceeds can cause the customer to pay more sales charges than they would have had they just held on to the original , Finra says .  During the period in question , SagePoint executed more than $ 895 million in UIT transactions , generating more than $ <extra_id_99> 17.2 million in sales charges , according to the letter of acceptance . Finra also says that the firm 's representatives recommended potentially unsuitable early rollovers that caused customers to pay more than $ 1.3 million in sales charges they would not have incurred if they 'd held their UITs to maturity . SagePoint consented to pay a $ 300,000 fine as well as restitution of around $ 1.3 million , plus interest , to customers , according to the letter of acceptance . SagePoint is one of the four broker-dealers -- along with FSC Securities Corporation , Royal Alliance Associates and Woodbury Financial -- that Advisor Group had on its network before it acquired Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services in February , and that remain standalone companies .  title: RayJay Fires Rep After Confrontation Over Black Lives Matter Sign	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

I also speak as a current final year dental student at King 's College London and I can confirm that black British students are seriously underrepresented in UK dental schools ( 2 % ) . In my cohort , only 6 % of the students are black . If we are already a minority at a training level , we definitely will be at a professional level .

Campaigners have accused the Metropolitan Police of unlawful behaviour after clashes with protesters at this weekend 's Black Lives Matter demonstrations in London . Tens of thousands of people have flooded the streets of the capital for four largely peaceful protests since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis .  The police response has seen riot cops deployed , a mounted police charge and the deployment of the controversial containment tactic `` kettling '' on at least <extra_id_99> four separate occasions . On three occasions across last week , protesters were kettled and held until after midnight . Campaigners alleged that police used the containment as an opportunity to film protesters ' faces and take their names and addresses as a condition for leaving the kettle . Campaign group the Network for Police Monitoring ( NetPol ) said : `` On Sunday evening , legal observers witnessed the police only allowing protesters ( including some minors as young as 12 ) to leave the kettles in ones and twos into a ` sterile area ' outside of the police lines , so that officers could film each individual .  title: Police Accused of Unlawful Tactics at London BLM Protests	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>
Use of Section 50 is controversial , as the powers are only supposed to be applied where police officers have genuine and reasonable belief that the person they 're speaking to has been involved in anti-social behaviour . Ahead of Sunday 's protest , human rights organisation Liberty and Black Protest Legal Support UK released a joint statement commenting on the use of kettling at Saturday 's demonstration . The groups said , `` We are particularly concerned with the use of [ s. 50 powers ] during the kettle .  The police grouped together <extra_id_99> hundreds of protesters , and stated that if they wished to leave they would have to give their name , address , date of birth and be filmed head to toe . This is concerning because s. 50 must not be used as a blanket power . Despite the police not being able to comment on what actions each protester had taken part in that could be deemed ` anti-social ' under the act , the police still insisted that everyone provide personal details before leaving . '' Barrister and expert on the law around protests , Tom Wainwright , questioned the legality of the police data gathering , tweeting , `` This is particularly worrying as the police know , following the Mengesha case , that this is unlawful .

Charging on horseback at demonstrators escalated tensions . It appears that the Met has n't learnt from the student demos [ of 2010 ] at all .

''  On Sunday , <extra_id_99> 35 officers were injured in London , along with numerous demonstrators , including at least one who was dragged out of the crowd unconscious , having been hit in the head with a baton . The Met 's approach contrasts with police forces elsewhere . In Manchester , 13,000 people turned out across two protests this weekend , according to the Greater Manchester Police . There were zero arrests .  title: Police Accused of Unlawful Tactics at London BLM Protests	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>
Reports indicate that the GMP took a very hands-off approach . One protester , who wished to remain anonymous , told VICE , `` There was no noticeable police presence and the demo grew organically , mainly ran by black kids . It just naturally moved around the streets really peacefully and safely , and there was no trouble .  No confrontation at all , and that 's a crowd of <extra_id_99> 10,000 -LSB- on Saturday -RSB- . '' Police in Bristol similarly took a light-touch approach . Avon and Somerset chief constable Andy Marsh released a statement on Monday explaining why officers did not intervene in the toppling of the statue of 17th century slave owner Edward Colston at Bristol 's Black Lives Matter demonstration . `` Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the image -- the statue -- of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade ?

Meanwhile , Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told Fox News that the department `` was able to support law enforcement efforts by governors and mayors in dozens of states around the country activating needed National Guard units under state command . '' `` These citizen soldiers gave state and local law enforcement the ability to successfully focus on protecting life , property and the right to peacefully protest , '' Hoffman told Fox News . Prior to the full mobilization of National Guard soldiers in cities including D.C. , New York City , Los Angeles and Minneapolis , an administration official noted there was `` rampant property destruction , arson and violence , '' which left numerous U.S. Secret Service agents injured .  The official told Fox News that approximately <extra_id_99> 700 federal , state and local law enforcement officers sustained injuries from violence related to the protests and civil unrest from May 26 through Tuesday . And according to the Department of Homeland Security Federal Protective Services , at least 150 federal buildings were damaged nationwide . `` The streets of America did n't spontaneously become peaceful last week , '' White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farrah told Fox News . `` It was a direct result of President Trump calling on governors and mayors to surge the National Guard in their states and restore law and order on America 's streets so that peaceful protesters could demonstrate safely .

In response to concerns , more than 1,300 medical professionals have signed an open letter , drafted by doctors and researchers at the University of Washington and posted online , asserting that the importance of protests outweighs the risk of COVID-19 transmission . `` Protests against systemic racism , which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence , must be supported , '' the letter states , adding that demonstrators should still follow `` public health best practices . '' But critics say the protests are reckless , noting that not so long ago public health experts chastised conservative protesters when they gathered at state capitols to demand an easing of restrictions to prevent lost jobs and failed businesses .  The Bedford analysis offers two different scenarios for crowd counts of <extra_id_99> 600,000 people , based on news sources and Wikipedia estimates of daily protests in more than 400 cities . One estimate is low , assuming a fatality rate of 0.5 % and a transmission rate of 0.9 -- one person with the disease infects , on average , 0.9 others . This scenario would lead to 1,500 new infections each day and 15,000 `` secondary '' infections among protestors ' friends and family , eventually causing 50 to 75 deaths . The higher estimate assumes a transmission rate of 0.95 and a fatality rate of 1 % .  title: Coronavirus: What’s the risk for George Floyd protesters?	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Ralph Northam ordered the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that sits on Richmond 's Monument Avenue . The statue has been the site of protest gatherings since Floyd 's death and had been scrawled with graffiti . Since 2015 , 110 Confederate memorials in 22 states , including the District of Columbia , have been removed , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .

Then the boos were drowned out by another call : `` Turn around .

The 2017 Lammy review into criminal justice found that : Black people are six times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched by police BAME defendants were 240 % more likely than white defendants to be give a prison sentence for a drug offence Black people make up 3 % of the general population but make up 12 % of the prisoners 21 % of children in custody are black . It is almost axiomatic that a police force which routinely discriminates against civilian people of colour would also discriminate against its black and Asian employees .  In 2019 a Met study of wages found that white police officers on average received # <extra_id_99> 1.80 an hour more than their black and Asian colleagues . In a 60-hour week that is equivalent to # 108 a week less and # 5,184 a year less than white police officers . In the legal profession the treatment of black lawyers is troubling to say the least . In 2018 the Bar Standards Board was driven to concede that BAME barristers are more likely to be subject to a complaint , less likely to have a complaint closed without investigation and more likely to have a complaint referred to disciplinary action .  title: 'Black Lives Matter does not want white people to be hunted, shamed, made to feel guilty and diminished'	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Brilliant organizing tactics by a group of young Egyptian techies via Facebook - including a memorial page called `` We are all Khaled Said '' - led to the peaceful toppling of President Hosni Mubarak . It was fascinating to watch how these young leaders mapped out a strategy to disperse police forces and coax Cairenes from working - and upper-class districts to join marches . They used this moment to unite Egyptians fed up with regime corruption and nepotism , rising food prices and heavy-handed behavior by police for which citizens had no recourse .  And it was astonishing to watch Egyptians of different classes , educations , religions and skin colors march beside each other by the tens of <extra_id_99> thousands into Tahrir Square in the name of dignity and justice . I will never forget a taxi driver telling me he had felt like `` a donkey '' before the upheaval , but standing with fellow Egyptians , he finally felt proud to be an Egyptian .

And I imagine , like the vast majority of Brits , I watched the protests with a little more than mild concern , wondering why it had exported these very American problems to our shores .

The human cost has been vast . Protests against the lockdown , which in normal times would have been entirely legitimate , have themselves been stamped on by the authorities .

The protests prompted by the death of George Floyd could spark between 50 and 500 coronavirus deaths across the United States for each day of mass gatherings , according to a new analysis by a Seattle scientist , the first major attempt to quantify the viral danger of dissent .  But that forecast toll -- fueled by an estimated 15,000 to <extra_id_99> 54,000 new infections spread during crowded chants , clashes and arrests -- is relatively small compared to the overall U.S. epidemic , representing about a 3 % to 6 % increase above the nation 's total new daily infections , reports Trevor Bedford , a computational biologist at Seattle 's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute who studies the spread of viruses . The precise tally may never been known because the rest of America is also gathering in ever-greater numbers , from book clubs and hair salons to restaurants and Las Vegas casinos . That also could fuel more infections . `` Because of the pandemic , we 're in a terrible situation where addressing systemic racism and bringing ( the ) economy back online carry health risks , '' wrote Bedford , in a series of Twitter posts .  title: Coronavirus: What’s the risk for George Floyd protesters?	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>
In response to concerns , more than 1,300 medical professionals have signed an open letter , drafted by doctors and researchers at the University of Washington and posted online , asserting that the importance of protests outweighs the risk of COVID-19 transmission . `` Protests against systemic racism , which fosters the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 on Black communities and also perpetuates police violence , must be supported , '' the letter states , adding that demonstrators should still follow `` public health best practices . '' But critics say the protests are reckless , noting that not so long ago public health experts chastised conservative protesters when they gathered at state capitols to demand an easing of restrictions to prevent lost jobs and failed businesses .  The Bedford analysis offers <extra_id_99> two different scenarios for crowd counts of 600,000 people , based on news sources and Wikipedia estimates of daily protests in more than 400 cities . One estimate is low , assuming a fatality rate of 0.5 % and a transmission rate of 0.9 -- one person with the disease infects , on average , 0.9 others . This scenario would lead to 1,500 new infections each day and 15,000 `` secondary '' infections among protestors ' friends and family , eventually causing 50 to 75 deaths . The higher estimate assumes a transmission rate of 0.95 and a fatality rate of 1 % .  title: Coronavirus: What’s the risk for George Floyd protesters?	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

20 hr 32 min ago The cities , states and countries finally putting an end to police neck restraints From CNN 's Harmeet Kaur and Janine Mack Police departments around the world are moving to ban neck restraints in the aftermath of George Floyd 's death and the widespread protests that followed . Neck restraints , or neck holds , refer to the practice of officers using their arm or leg to restrain someone 's neck . The technique has been a subject of controversy for years , particularly following the death of Eric Garner in 2014 after a police officer was accused of choking him .  The term `` chokehold '' is often used in mainstream discourse to refer to any neck hold , but police generally categorize neck restraints in <extra_id_99> two ways : the stranglehold and the chokehold . Strangeholds -- also called carotid restraints , sleeper holds or blood chokes -- temporarily cut off blood flow to the brain and are meant to render a subject unconscious for a time . Chokeholds -- also called airway holds -- restrict breathing by applying pressure to the windpipe . Law enforcement officers say the techniques are used to gain control of aggressive or resisting subjects .  title: June 10 Black Lives Matter protests	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

It did not always seem likely -- or even possible -- that the American public would reach such an agreement about the role of racism in policing . There was a time when it seemed to Dominique Alexander , an activist in Dallas , that the Black Lives Matter movement might collapse under the weight of scrutiny about the tone of its message and accusations about `` reverse racism '' against white people -- accusations its organizers strongly rejected . Alexander recalled the rally he organized in Dallas during the summer of 2016 to protest the deaths of two black men -- Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana -- who were fatally shot by police .  That day , a sniper who was not affiliated with the protesters killed <extra_id_99> five Dallas police officers . Critics pounced , amplifying long-running accusations that the movement 's organizers encouraged anti-police violence .

First heard and recorded in the late 1920s by Victor Records , this spiritual , `` He Never Said a Mumblin ' Word '' chronicles the silent reserve of Jesus during his trial and execution . Joyce recognized the parallels of Floyd 's final desperation of calling out to his mother while having his life literally pressed from him . Joyce internalized the poignant correlation of Floyd 's final words to those in the spiritual .  To incorporate the spiritual into his new composition , Joyce took the <extra_id_99> 11 measures plus a pick-up note structure of `` He Never Said a Mumblin ' Word , '' to set the text into seven phrases . He then arranged the verse into 12 variations , correlating to the Stations of the Cross .

Joyce also selected seven unique pitches from the `` a Mumblin '' spiritual , creating a special seven-note-scale that became the architecture for his new work , `` He Hung His Head and Died ( 12 Variations for George Floyd ) .

Chicago Police Department internal files have also shown that officers are <extra_id_99> 14 times more likely to use excessive force against Black men than white men . And an influx of African migrants to the United States in recent years has led to a growing conversation of diverse voices surrounding these issues .

Enyia 's parents came to Chicago from Nigeria with the intention of returning home .  title: “We’re Fighting the Same Fight”: African Migrants on End SARS and Black Lives Matter	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Specifically speaking of the city of Philadelphia , that you may know as `` The City of Brotherly Love . '' A city with so much anger and pain from the years of endless oppression , to systematic injustice , to police brutality , all coming to life in our city streets . Anger that led to protests forming , infuriated protests becoming riots and riots leading to looting .  <extra_id_99> Hundreds of people all over the city looting small and big-name brand businesses . The country needs a leader in these hard times , someone to take action and stand for what 's right and wrong under all the chaos .

`` We have a national problem of police brutality ... It requires a national solution , '' said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries , D-N.Y. `` Here in America , every black mother and every black father has to have the talk with their child about what to do when approached by police . Any encounter can turn deadly , not because of criminal conduct but because of the color of their skin . ''  Jeffries said he had the talk with his <extra_id_99> two sons - and it was similar to the talk he had with his father decades ago . `` Nothing has changed , '' Jeffries said . Republicans countered that federal mandates go too far . Rep. Debbie Lesko , R-Ariz. , says most police are `` good , honest people trying to help our community , '' so lawmakers should n't `` throw the baby out with the bathwater .

( In my 8 years as Mayor of Miami , I had three black chiefs : Clarence Dickson , Perry Anderson and Calvin Ross ) . We designed and initiated ( in both the county and the City of Miami ) police-youth dialogues that sensitize both sides to the needs and fears of the other . We are on our way to instituting , at the county level , a civilian independent panel -- similar to the one we instituted 30 years ago in the City of Miami .  For those who think we can not achieve neighborhood harmony , I point to the West Grove , where the <extra_id_99> two elementary schools -LRB- Carver and Tucker -RRB- have achieved `` A '' ratings while educating the most racially diverse students anywhere . And I point to a Children 's Trust that has just about achieved universal childcare for all , with a budget well in excess of $ 100 million . Like the rest of the nation , and perhaps a little more because of our dependency on the leisure industry , we were hit hard by the novel coronavirus . As we strive to slowly and methodically recover from that crisis , we are now beset by a massive , heartfelt reaction to the cruelty of authorities in other cities , and the nonchalance of leaders at various levels .  title: In Memoriam George Floyd: Our Duty Going Forward	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

) The brutality was shocking enough that the UN Human Rights Council called for an investigation . The UN report revealed that over 6,000 unarmed Palestinians demonstrators were shot by Israeli military snipers ( thousands more suffered from tear gas inhalation ) . 189 Palestinians -- 35 of them children -- were killed ( since the end of the 2018 reporting period , at least 25 more have been killed ) : The Commission found reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers shot at journalists , health workers , children and persons with disabilities , knowing they were clearly recognizable as such .  During the protests , <extra_id_99> 4 Israeli soldiers were injured -LRB- one was killed on a protest day , but not in connection with the protests -RRB- .

The protest followed 12 years of Israeli blockade and frequent airstrikes . Before that were 38 years of occupation . The Palestinians had been exiled from their homes and their land 20 years before that .  This is the context that the Rabbinical Assembly left out of its May 2019 statement , which read in part , We mourn the deaths of <extra_id_99> four Israeli civilians killed by Hamas rockets . We extend our sincerest condolences to their families and pray for the full and speedy recovery of those who are wounded . The Union for Reform Judaism ( URJ ) issued a similar statement in November 2019 , during another `` escalation . '' This time , Israel had assassinated a Palestinian military leader ; militants in Gaza had responded by firing rockets which had killed no one ; Israel carried out ground and air attacks , indiscriminately killing 36 Palestinians .  title: Selective Tolerance: AIPAC and its Pro-Apartheid Ilk Come to Bat for Black Lives Matter	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>
We pray for the healing of the injured and for the safety of the Israel Defense Forces as they combat this assault on Israeli sovereignty and security ... We remain in solidarity with the State of Israel and all Israelis even as we pray for Israel 's safety and security , for an end to this tragic violence , and for a future of real , lasting , and sustainable peace for Israel and for the Palestinian people . While the groups claim that Israel is merely defending itself from Gaza rockets , the fact is that Palestinian rockets came after Israeli violence , and have killed a total of 30 Israelis in all the years they 've been used , while Israeli air strikes have killed over 4,000 Gazans . The possibility of real , lasting , and sustainable peace seems remote when the oppression of Gaza is unacknowledged .

AJWS claims to advocate for universal human rights , specifically : participation in the political process that affects one 's daily life , free expression without censorship , peaceful pursuit of social change , and a life free from violence . AJWS points out : Although many countries have ratified an international covenant that safeguards basic human rights ... governments often stray from their pledges and ... get away with shocking abuses . Israel ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , the 1966 Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and the 1966 Covenant on Economic and Social Rights -- yet it regularly detains and incarcerates children , keeps 5 million Palestinians in the occupied Territories permanently disenfranchised , while controlling every aspect of their lives ; and withholds the means to an adequate education and standard of living , and freedom from violence and fear .  title: Selective Tolerance: AIPAC and its Pro-Apartheid Ilk Come to Bat for Black Lives Matter	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Minnesota prosecutors said in a new court filing this week that the four cops charged in George Floyd 's death should face harsher sentences if convicted , citing the Black man 's vulnerability and the position of trust the now-former officers held at the time . The state 's attorney general , Keith Ellison , had previously told a Hennepin County court that he planned to seek `` upward departures '' in sentencing guidelines because police `` inflicted gratuitous pain on Mr. Floyd . '' The newly filed memo , obtained Monday by the Star Tribune , provides a detailed argument for why the Minneapolis cops deserve to be punished more harshly if they 're found guilty .  When police arrived at the scene to investigate a report of a man passing a counterfeit $ <extra_id_99> 20 bill on Memorial Day , they held a `` defined relationship '' of authority over the 46-year-old suspect , prosecutors reportedly wrote in the memo . Derek Chauvin , the white officer who was caught on video kneeling on Floyd 's neck , and his three alleged accomplices used their authority to `` dominate and control '' the unarmed man , who was then handcuffed , pinned to the ground and ultimately killed , Ellison 's office said . This combination of photos provided by the Hennepin County Sheriff 's Office in Minnesota on Wednesday , June 3 , 2020 , shows from left , former Minneapolis police officers Derek Chauvin , J. Alexander Kueng , Thomas Lane and Tou Thao . Prosecutors cited a previous court ruling that supported longer sentences for cases when a power imbalance makes it difficult for victims to protect themselves , the Tribune reported .  title: Prosecutors push for harsher sentences against cops charged in George Floyd’s death	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

'' Since the County Executive 's call for removal of the two statues on June 25 , leaders across the country have taken swift action to acknowledge and immediately remove hurtful images of the past , including the State of Mississippi , the NFL team in Washington , D.C. and NASCAR .  title: EXECUTIVE FRANK WHITE SADDENED LEGISLATURE WILL NOT SAY: 'BLACK LIVES MATTER' IN JACKSON COUNTY!!!	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

The national Black Lives Matter protest movement , rekindled in the days after an unarmed George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis last May , continues to shine a light on what it calls systemic racism and police brutality from America 's small towns to its urban centers . Portland , Oregon , has remained a flashpoint of national and global demonstrations that erupted after video emerged of Floyd pleading that he could n't breathe as a police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee to the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes . As in other parts of the country , the protests in Portland were mostly peaceful , though they have at times devolved into violence , vandalism and arson .  Protesters last weekend pulled down barricades , moved them into streets and attempted to set <extra_id_99> a building on fire . On Sunday , federal law enforcement officers dispersed protesters with gas , police said . Nearly two months after Floyd 's death set off massive national and international protests , Black Lives Matter demonstrations are still happening in some places , including : Chicago , Illinois Protesters gathered near the home of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Saturday -- one day after violent clashes left police and demonstrators injured , CNN affiliate WLS reported .

It reminds the court that the police operate an off-the-books detention warehouse , Homan Square , where over 7,000 predominantly Black and Latino Chicagoans have been placed in incommunicado detention . They called Chicago police and Mayor Lori Lightfoot `` unable and unwilling to protect protesters , '' as the police department `` intends to work with the federal agents . '' The harsh tactics visited upon Washington , D.C. , and Portland -- cities Trump decried as run by `` radical-left Democrats '' -- amount to what the suit calls a `` federal policy of conducting illegal arrests '' that it seeks to prevent from reaching Chicago .  `` -LSB- N -RSB- either the President , Defendant Barr , nor Defendant Wolf gave any assurance that the ` <extra_id_99> hundreds ' of federal agents flooding Chicago would leave protestors alone . At no time did they acknowledge that the federal government had overstepped in Portland , '' the suit writes . In the wake of the ongoing Portland operation , Chicago 's Fraternal Order of Police president urged Trump 's intervention .

Trump may try to win the vote this November but if he loses he wo n't accept the the results . Does this mean we should ignore the election as he does ? Not exactly but it means we must embrace what Cornel West calls an inside-outside strategy that aims to infiltrate American institutions while also recognizing this comes with a brutal reality check that at a certain point capital and the violence behind it always intervenes in purely political projects .  The electoral strategy Trump is playing to is most obvious in his reversal of Obama era anti-discrimination in housing initiatives , his bizarre claim that Joe Biden will destroy suburbs , his takeover of American cities with federal occupying armies and his advertisement of <extra_id_99> an elderly white woman being attacked by a burglar . All of these point to a recycling of his 2016 effort to demonize multiracial American cities by painting them as dangerous to the white American male as they could steal your job , your property , and your woman -- the three defining ownerships of capital . All ownership itself is theft and violence upon the natural world .

SEATTLE -- A federal judge has found the Seattle Police Department in contempt of court for the indiscriminate use of pepper-filled `` blast balls '' and pepper spray during Black Lives Matter protests this fall , but also cited instances where police were justified in using force against demonstrators . U.S. District Judge Richard Jones issued a 27-page order Monday in response to a motion by BLM Seattle-King County to find the police department in contempt of his earlier injunction preventing police from using force against peaceful protesters .  Jones found a total of four `` clear violations '' of the injunction : one involving the use of pepper spray and the other <extra_id_99> three involving blast balls , grenadelike devices that explode and spew pepper gas . It 's a weapon the judge says raises serious issues with the court . `` Of the less lethal weapons , the Court is most concerned about SPD 's use of blast balls , the most indiscriminate of the four '' crowd-control weapons whose use he examined . `` SPD has often hurled blast balls into crowds of protesters '' when no immediate threat to the officers ' safety or public property could be identified , the judge found .  title: Judge holds Seattle police in contempt for actions during BLM protests	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

The NBA 's restart plan has been the most successful of all the leagues , as no players or staff members tested positive after they initially arrived in the bubble . Isolated from the outside world for more than 100 days , the Los Angeles Lakers clinched the NBA Championship over the Miami Heat . The MLB reimagined their schedule and had teams play teams in their region .  Since the MLB season started in the middle of July , teams only played <extra_id_99> 60 games rather than the standard 180 . Unlike the NBA , the MLB dealt with positive COVID-19 cases that affected their schedule . Over 40 games were canceled , and teams were forced to take disciplinary action against players that failed to abide by the MLB 's strict protocols . Despite the obstacles , the league made adjustments throughout the season and eventually crowned the Los Angeles Dodgers the World Series champions on Oct. 27 , even as a Dodgers player tested positive in the middle of a game .  title: Year in Review: Kobe, COVID-19 and BLM’s Impact on Professional Sports	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

SJPD also backed off the use of tear-gas and similar agents after health experts decried their respiratory effects amid the COVID-19 pandemic . Without naming the officer , the report also addresses Officer Jared Yuen 's profane comments toward protesters that garnered international attention during the May and June protests . The department affirmed Yuen is now on a `` non-enforcement assignment '' pending an internal affairs investigation .  Yuen accounted for 1,079 of <extra_id_99> 1,247 protest-related police complaints received by the department , according to the report . The report notes officer injuries -- including an officer who was knocked unconscious by a man 's punch -- and related attacks , including 181 instances of them being hit by objects like frozen water bottles or being fired at with a potato gun in one instance . But while the document also addresses injuries to protesters , the language is general and sticks closely to what has already been reported by media or disclosed in eyewitness videos . Those injured in the incidents include community activist and former police bias trainer Derrick Sanderlin , who was shot in the groin with a police rubber bullet while trying to de-escalate a standoff between protesters and police ; Tim Harper , a citizen who helped carry an injured officer to safety then was later hit in the stomach with a police projectile ; and David Baca , who was hit in the Adam 's apple by an officer 's baton when he approached a skirmish line with the aim of taking down an officer 's name and badge number .  title: In George Floyd protest report, San Jose police concede training gaps but stand by response	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Gooding is charged with three misdemeanor counts of forcible touching and sexual abuse involving <extra_id_99> three women in Manhattan bars and restaurants in June 2019 , October 2018 and September 2018 . He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges . The hearing was held to argue over issues of discovery and what kind of evidence can and can not be admitted , and what kinds of questions witnesses can be asked at trial . Gooding 's lawyer , Peter Toumbekis , argued that he should be allowed to question one of the accusers , who says Gooding groped her breast at the Magic Hour Rooftop Bar and Lounge last summer , about how she feels about her breast size .  title: Cuba Gooding Jr. wears 'Black Lives Matter' mask at groping case court appearance	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Gooding is not charged with any crimes in connection with these accusations . Prosecutors intend to offer these witnesses ' testimony at the trial to demonstrate an alleged pattern of `` prior bad acts '' by Gooding .  Farber earlier ruled that only two of the <extra_id_99> 19 would be allowed to testify . Gooding was last in court in person in January . By mid-March , most in-person court proceedings in New York were suspended to stop the spread of the coronavirus .

Durkan 's task force was met with criticism , much of it from KCEN , as soon as she announced the funding source . The main controversy with Durkan 's task force is that it will take the $ 100 million for communities of color out of the new JumpStart Seattle payroll tax . Organizations such as KCEN would like to see that $ 100 million removed from the Seattle Police Department budget and reinvested into the community .  Over <extra_id_99> 50 local organizations so far have signed on to a solidarity budget that opposes using JumpStart funds for this $ 100 million investment . Complicating the optics is the fact that Durkan was opposed to the JumpStart tax , going so far as to veto the spending plan this summer , which the Seattle City Council later overrode . Durkan is leaning on JumpStart to fill 2021 budget holes and to satisfy these investment commitments .

The Klan and other white supremacist groups have kept strong roots in this part of the state since the Civil War , organizing events in East Texas as recently as a couple of years ago . According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , at least two Klan-related groups were active in East Texas in 2019 . Those who know even a little of the region 's history and reputations have been shocked by the number and size of protests organized not just in a relative hub like Tyler but in the smaller towns throughout East Texas , each with its own history of injustice .  About <extra_id_99> 100 people showed up to protest in Jasper , which became synonymous with racial hate in 1998 when three white men tied James Byrd Jr. , a black man , to the back of a pickup truck and violently dragged him to death . Two of the men have since been executed , and the third is serving a life sentence . Jaylen Weatherred , who is black and a Lufkin native , was going to organize a protest there in early June before he saw someone had beat him to the punch . He was surprised to see that most protesters appeared to be white , not black , and the group was small , unlike the protest he had driven to in Houston a couple of days before .  title: George Floyd Killing Energizes a New Generation in the Fight Against Racism	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Unlike in some of the smaller East Texas towns , Tyler activists have been consistently protesting since Floyd 's death , and they have no plans of stopping . When Amori Mitchell and other activists announced that demonstrators would march from downtown to the southern , whiter part of Tyler in the days after Floyd 's death , they received threats from white supremacists . Mitchell , who is black , took that as a sign that not much had changed in racially segregated Tyler .  According to organizers and Tyler police , at least <extra_id_99> two men threateningly drove their car toward protesters and local media but did not injure anyone . Shackelford and Mitchell were among the organizers who met with city leaders earlier this month to lay out their agenda for how to turn the demonstrations into action . `` That meant a lot to us to have them come out and say they 're still pushing the issue , '' Mitchell said . Mitchell , who is 31 , wonders whether her young nieces and nephews will have a different experience than she did growing up in Tyler .  title: George Floyd Killing Energizes a New Generation in the Fight Against Racism	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>
Mitchell , who is 31 , wonders whether her young nieces and nephews will have a different experience than she did growing up in Tyler . They 're confused about why their older family members caution them against wearing hoodies outside , not yet aware of the potentially deadly ramifications of racism .

Daniel has been watching <extra_id_99> hundreds of people of all races show up to regular protests in Tyler this month and praying it means something will really change this time . `` It 's enough of the same thing over and over .

The protests are defined by tens of <extra_id_99> thousands of people of conscience who are insisting that we live up to our values -- our values as people and our values as a nation . When I joined the military , some 50 years ago , I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution . Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens -- much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief , with military leadership standing alongside . We must reject any thinking of our cities as a `` battlespace '' that our uniformed military is called upon to `` dominate .

But they share the common thread of violence marring the peaceful demands of the people . Saturday afternoon I spoke with someone who had participated in the protest that morning . Olivia Everett , 16 , went with some friends to join what was listed in a Facebook event as a non-violent protest .  She stood at the corner of High and Broad , alongside <extra_id_99> hundreds of other protesters , holding signs and chanting phrases led by a community organizer at the front of the crowd . Police had a row of bikes set up in a makeshift barrier , preventing protesters from entering the lot of the Statehouse .

The march started in the Short North Arts District , which has arguably contributed to the recent gentrification of the neighborhood in which I spent most of my life .

When I approached the barrier at the front , I heard not provocation but discussion . Nobody wanted conflict . Many highway patrol officers , some but not all of whom wore body cameras , spoke with demonstrators about the protests ; from what little I could hear , ( nobody was shouting at each other ) the officers supported the protest .  I watched the crowd grow and grow to <extra_id_99> hundreds of people , chanting phrases such as `` No justice , no peace , no racist police '' and `` Say his name , George Floyd , say his name . '' Occasionally protesters would kneel or lie on the ground , imitating victims of police violence and chanting , `` Hands up , do n't shoot . '' In the crowd were people of all ages , even children . By noon on Saturday , police had deployed tear gas and pepper-sprayed protesters , so the presence of people under the age of 12 worried me .  title: A personal account of the George Floyd protests in Columbus, Ohio	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Many looked to me to be quite young , high school age . And they were jumpy .

I heard sirens the whole time and watched from alleyways as police vans sped downtown . At one point , I narrowly missed getting hit by a car racing down an alleyway . I made it home five minutes before curfew , shaken but unscathed .  I keep returning to this thought : If I , a white woman , feel so terrified right now , how do the <extra_id_99> hundreds of Black protesters feel ? I imagine they feel more fear than I can possibly know . And it makes me think that that fear may be a part of the root of all of this : the day-to-day fear for one 's life that the American police system instills in Black Americans , and the bravery it takes to stand up to a system rigged against them . We are living at the culmination of hundreds of years of pain and injustice .  title: A personal account of the George Floyd protests in Columbus, Ohio	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Polling data certainly supports this point . The public has consistently viewed Trump 's handling of race relations worse than his performance on just about any other issue . Americans have given Trump low marks for how he 's handled most issues other than the economy .  But they 've even more strongly disapproved of his performance on race relations , consistently rating him at about <extra_id_99> 30 points underwater throughout his presidency . That 's already showing up in the earliest polling on the protests . Trump 's tweet below , which many decried as racist , and Twitter flagged for glorifying violence , was one of the president 's most unpopular . `` I ca n't stand back & watch this happen to a great American City , Minneapolis .  title: George Floyd protests will not help Trump win reelection.

YouGov has asked Americans to evaluate Trump 's tweets since the early days of his presidency . The tweet above drew unusually strong disapproval - with a plurality of 40 percent rating it `` terrible , '' a majority of 52 % rating it `` bad '' or `` terrible , '' and 31 percent calling it `` good '' or `` great . '' Moreover , the most recent polling shows that most Americans think Trump is racist .  In a YouGov-Yahoo survey conducted this past weekend , <extra_id_99> 52 % said the president is a racist compared with only 37 % who said he is not . So it 's not surprising that early polling shows strong public disapproval of how the president is handling the protests . In the latest Morning Consult Poll , only 30 percent said he 's doing an `` excellent , '' `` very good '' or `` good '' job of addressing the situation . A plurality of 42 % , meanwhile , think he 's doing a `` poor '' job , and a majority of 54 % think he 's doing a poor or `` only fair '' job of responding to the protests .  title: George Floyd protests will not help Trump win reelection.

Gathered on a breezy Saturday morning on May 30 , tens of thousands of individuals far and wide gathered at Pan Pacific Park on the westside of Los Angeles for a Black Lives Matter rally . Standing 6-feet apart and donning face masks and wielding signs , the rally was meant to be a more muted yet equally as powerfully influential as the demonstration the previous night in Downtown LA. .  Filipino American filmmaker Jon Jon Augustavo was among the first of <extra_id_99> thousands who arrived at the demonstration and , like others , noticed an extraordinary sense of community and harmony as the speakers took turns at the podium and spoke from the heart about the need for systemic change in law enforcement across the country . `` I 'm from Seattle and that 's my heart , but [ this protest ] was the first time in 10 years that I was proud to call Los Angeles my home , '' Augustavo told the Asian Journal .

The protest itself was peaceful . And then the cops came . Following days of civil unrest across the country , Los Angeles was one of several major cities across the world to hold rallies and marches that brought together thousands of people protesting the pattern of police brutality and murders of unarmed Black individuals .

A video , which has now gone viral , shows the officer forcing Floyd down despite Floyd 's screaming , `` I ca n't breathe '' multiple times .

The murder follows a string of other murders of Black individuals -- Breonna Taylor on March 13 , who was gunned down in her home and Ahmaud Arbery , who was killed by two white civilians while jogging -- this year .  title: Why they protest: Filipinos express support for Black Lives Matter, call for structural police reform	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

The racial breakdown of law enforcement and representation in the criminal justice system in the U.K. is broadly similar to that in the United States . Black people in the U.K. are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched by the police than white people , which the Equality and Human Rights commission attributes to `` racial discrimination . '' In the U.K. , Black , Asian and minority ethnic ( BAME ) residents make up 25 % of the adult prison population and 40 % of the youth custody population , despite comprising 14 % of the overall population .

MINNEAPOLIS - A judge tentatively scheduled a March 2021 trial date for the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd 's death , though considerable uncertainty remains about how the case will unfold following a hearing here Monday afternoon .  Three of the <extra_id_99> four ex-officers appeared in person at a Hennepin County courtroom Monday for a joint hearing , with the one facing the most serious charges - Derek Chauvin , who was filmed driving his knee into Floyd 's neck - appeared remotely from the state prison where he is being held . It is unclear if some or all of the officers will be tried together or separately . While prosecutors seem to be pushing for a consolidated trial , defense attorneys are instead expected to push for separate prosecutions . Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder , while the other three - Tou Thao , Thomas Lane and J.

The horrors in the film are not perpetrated by obvious , stereotypical horror bad-guy characters , but rather by your white , middle-class liberal neighbors .  title: 10 Best Films To Better Understand Black Lives Matter	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

While protesters camp out in our city parks , harass police officers attempting to keep the peace , and enjoy the taffy-soft submission of leftist mayors and governors across the country , U.S. cities are experiencing a dramatic uptick in violent deaths . But as hundreds of Americans perish within our own borders each week , the protests focus only on the deaths that help advance the cause of defeating the entirety of law enforcement within the United States . And they 're not losing .  <extra_id_99> Hundreds of members of the NYPD have chosen to retire as Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo cowed to the mobs and refused to back up the police department , further promising to gut the budget . NYC additionally disbanded a unit of more than 500 plain-clothed police officers specifically tasked with curbing violent crime at a time when the city is seeing dramatic spikes in murders , burglaries , and other violent attacks . The Minneapolis city council unanimously voted to disband their entire police department and other cities have promised much the same . With no back up from leaders in their own cities and looming congressional action promising to destroy much-needed protection , police have understandably retreated .  title: Five Black Children Murdered this Month that 'Black Lives Matter' will Never Mention	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Defense attorneys asked for the cameras , saying it would help balance what the public has heard about the case , but prosecutors objected . The judge has not ruled on whether to allow cameras for the trial itself , but has said he is open to it . The charges against Chauvin are unintentional second-degree murder , third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter .  Second-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison , third-degree murder carries up to 25 years and manslaughter up to <extra_id_99> 10 . The other three former officers are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter . Those charges are legally tantamount to the counts against Chauvin and carry the same penalties . After the hearings , Selwyn Jones , Floyd 's uncle , said he found it `` totally hideous '' that Lane and Kueng made bail , while `` my nephew will never have a chance to be free ever again .  title: Judge warns of possible move of trial in George Floyd death	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Some Minnesota Democrats reportedly began taking steps to recruit candidates to take on Omar just two months into her first term . While Omar won the Minnesota Democratic -- Farmer -- Labor Party , or DFL , endorsement last month , she is being challenged by two other Democrats in the primary on August 11 and a crowded Republican field . Melton-Meaux poses the most serious threat , having picked up a number of endorsements , including local civil rights champion Josie Johnson ; Nekima Levy Armstrong , the former president of the Minneapolis NAACP ; longtime state Sen. Dick Cohen , and some other local elected officials .  Melton-Meaux is also backed by <extra_id_99> two of Minnesota 's most prominent DFL donors , Sam and Sylvia Kaplan . The Kaplans , top bundlers for Barack Obama 's 2008 campaign who were rewarded with an ambassadorship , have been credited with helping launch the career of the late Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone . In a Star Tribune report last year , Sylvia said it was too early to say whether a primary against Omar was warranted but called the controversies a `` distraction for the party '' and said she hopes the congresswoman `` stops the tweeting . '' Freshman Rep. Dean Phillips has been conspicuously silent amid the challenge to Omar in his neighboring district , despite the party 's public hostility toward primary challenges in general .  title: Ilhan Omar’s Primary Opponent Hit Black Lives Matter in 2015, Urged Activists to Focus on Crime and Education	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>
Others who advocate for keeping them say they have historical or artistic value and their removal amounts to erasing history . A judge in Richmond on Monday issued an injunction preventing Northam 's administration from removing an iconic statue of Lee for 10 days .

The lawsuit was filed by William C. Gregory , who is described in the complaint as a descendant of <extra_id_99> two signatories to the deed . Named as defendants are Northam and the director of the Department of General Services , the agency tasked with handling the removal . `` ( Gregory 's ) family has taken pride for 130 years in this statue resting upon land belonging to his family and transferred to the Commonwealth in consideration of the Commonwealth contractually guaranteeing to perpetually care for and protect the Lee Monument , '' the lawsuit says .

Looking back at the days and hours leading up to the moment that shocked Americans , the complaint argues Trump is to blame for expressing his intent to violently attack protesters and `` dominate '' them . `` For defendants to describe their actions as ` domination ' is telling . To dominate is to establish supremacy by subjugation of others , '' the complaint states .  It goes on to explain that `` precisely such domination -- in the form of centuries of white supremacy and subjugation of Black lives , '' was the core focus in Lafayette Square , and cites <extra_id_99> 12 other protests against racial injustice met with violence against black people and their allies . Accusing the president of targeting black demonstrators and civil rights activists with his calls for violence , the complaint argues Trump expressed support for majority white protests last month when armed demonstrators threatened lawmakers and stormed statehouses calling for an end to coronavirus stay-at-home orders . One of the most indelible remarks by Trump over the last three years -- that `` You had very fine people , on both sides '' in the violent Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville , Virginia -- is another example of the president 's subjective stance on demonstrators based on race , the complaint argues .

All At The Protests Police Reform 23 min ago GOP Senator Lankford says he supports ban on police use of chokeholds From CNN 's Nicky Robertson and Allison Main Senator James Lankford , a Republican from Oklahoma , told CNN today he supports banning the use of chokeholds by police . `` I do believe chokeholds should be banned , '' Lankford told CNN 's Jake Tapper on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' Lankford noted that departments have already de-facto banned chokeholds because they do not train officers to use it and tell officers that they should not use things that they have not been trained to do .  As of Friday , June 12 , at least <extra_id_99> 20 cities and municipalities in the United States are starting to ban or have banned the use of chokeholds in policing , according to information gathered by CNN . President Trump last week seemed to indicate that he supported a ban , but his comments still left some questions . `` I do n't like chokeholds , '' he told Fox in an interviews . He said at times there is a one-on-one fight for a person 's life in which a chokehold is used .  title: Black Lives Matter protests across the US and world	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

 Associated Press TOKYO -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Holding handmade signs that read `` Black Lives Matter , '' several <extra_id_99> hundred people marched peacefully at a Tokyo park Sunday , highlighting the outrage over the death of George Floyd even in a country often perceived as homogeneous and untouched by racial issues . Mitsuaki Shidara , standing in the crowd at Yoyogi Park , said Japan has plenty of discrimination problems , but they 're overlooked . `` We are all human first , but we are divided by nationality , gender , religion , skin color , '' he said , wearing a pendant with the Japanese character for `` love , '' which he said was his favorite word . `` What 's happening in the U.S. shows racism is going on , even after 400 years , '' said Shidara , who works for a food maker .  title: Japan, New Zealand march to mourn George Floyd, seek change	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Sunday 's turnout in Tokyo underlined how Japan has historically been reticent in dealing with diversity and is now trying to understand the Black Lives Matter movement and grapple with its own history of discrimination . Such attitudes date back to the feudal era , with the Buraku underclass , and include more recently the offspring of marriages between Japanese and non-Japanese . The children are called `` hafu , '' derived from `` half , '' which critics resent as discriminatory .  Last week , a rally with similar themes in Tokyo drew several <extra_id_99> hundred people , and one in Osaka , in central Japan , drew about 2,000 . More Black Lives Matter gatherings are planned for next week , in the southwestern city of Fukuoka and the central city of Nagoya . The rallies reflect how more people of various backgrounds are becoming part of a rapidly globalizing Japan . Although Japan is not reputed for police brutality , people have come forward recently , complaining that police have treated foreigners , especially black people , unfairly , stopping them for no reason , or have handled people with unneeded force .  title: Japan, New Zealand march to mourn George Floyd, seek change	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
The same organizations that advocate for migrant rights are lending their support to Black Lives Matter , and many feel compelled to also march , often saying they relate to the struggle Black people face with punitive policing and racism . But with the deployment of federal immigration authorities to marches around the country , and with the existing relationships many local jails have with them , even marching peacefully -- or in some cases , being at the wrong place at the wrong time -- can upend someone 's life as they know it in the U.S. . At least four immigrants were arrested by Phoenix police as marches were beginning to take hold .  Three of the <extra_id_99> four are protected through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which shields immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation and allows them to work . Because the local jail allows officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its facilities , they all ended up in immigration custody , including a well-known young activist who has DACA protections and who was released the next day after intense pressure from immigration activists . The activist , Máxima Guerrero , had been serving as a legal observer and was n't participating in the protest when she was arrested , according to the organization she works for . Immigrants -- and especially Latinos -- have been targeted in protests before .  title: For Immigrants, Marching with Black Lives Matter Has Risks	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>
Janis , who now runs a nonprofit that advocates for good jobs for communities of color in the U.S. , started getting calls from families who reported their relatives had been arrested and they could n't locate them , including the families of several pregnant women who Janis said were n't involved in the protests . `` I just remember being so angry and outraged and people being so afraid , '' Janis said . Central America was in the aftermath of decades-long civil wars , and people were terrified of being forced to return , she said .  Janis does n't recall what became of the <extra_id_99> three or four pregnant women she helped in that time . `` It just felt triply outrageous that these police officers were arresting these pregnant women for no reason and sending them off to these terrible situations . It just reeked of inhumanity , '' Janis said .

Don Lewis , who served as a special prosecutor in the Ramsey County case against Jeronimo Yanez , the former St. Anthony police officer who was acquitted for killing Philando Castile in 2016 , has said that the third-degree murder count was viewed by many as `` defective '' in the Floyd case . `` I 'm still somewhat perplexed by the way it was charged , '' Lewis said several months ago . Similar questions about third-degree murder also arose when Freeman 's office tried former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor in 2019 for fatally shooting Justine Ruszczyk Damond .  But prosecutors noted at trial that Noor fired his gun across his partner 's body and out of a squad window toward occupied homes while <extra_id_99> a teenager was bicycling nearby . Jurors convicted Noor of the count along with second-degree manslaughter . They acquitted him of second-degree murder .

Chauvin still faces the higher charge of second-degree unintentional murder and a second-degree manslaughter charge in Floyd 's death on May 25 , which sparked nationwide protests and a reckoning over race and policing this summer . Chauvin , who was released on $ 1 million bond earlier this month , was seen in videos of the incident kneeling on Floyd 's neck for almost eight minutes , while the Black man told Chauvin and three other officers -- Tou Thao , Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng -- that he could n't breathe . In the ruling issued Wednesday , Judge Peter Cahill also denied motions to dismiss charges against the other now-former Minneapolis police officers , who have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter .  A hearing was held on the motions in September -- the first time all <extra_id_99> four defendants appeared in court together . Cahill 's ruling states the jury should decide if the state of Minnesota has proven the guilt of the former officers , writing in his summary that the state has met the burden of probable cause in the charges against Thao , Lane and Kueng . The exception was the third-degree murder charge against Chauvin . Cahill wrote the charge can `` be sustained only in situations in which the defendant 's actions were 'em inently dangerous to other persons ' and were not specifically directed at the particular person whose death occurred .

But the context , of course , is that we live in a country where Black people 's bodies are brutalized for the most mundane things .  I was a Black woman in the hands of police against the context of <extra_id_99> thousands of women accusing police of sexual assault in the past decade . The context is that our nation was roiling then and is roiling still with the righteous fury of protesters and the indignant rage of bigots in and out of uniform .

THE FACTS : This is misleading . The pandemic has severely lessened the demand for crude oil . But through June , the United States was still importing more crude oil than it was selling overseas , according to the Census Bureau .  While the United States has become less reliant on foreign oil , it only produces 11.3 million barrels a day and consumes <extra_id_99> 18.5 million barrels of liquid fuels daily , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . Technological advances like fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed the U.S. to greatly increase production , but the country still imports millions of barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia , Canada , Iraq and other countries . One reason is that foreign oil is more affordable . Another is that much of what the U.S. produces is hard for domestic refiners to convert to practical use .  title: President Trump accuses Black Lives Matter of coordinating violent protests across nation	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

An analysis by the U.S. Department of Justice found that neighborhoods in San Jose which received the most investment from the city 's youth services saw the steepest declines in gang crime . However , nearly half of the recipients of the city 's youth resources and grants are not from groups with the highest risk of gang violence -- a figure largely attributable to a fear of criminalization . We know what works and what does n't work when it comes to gang violence .  So why , despite a decline in juvenile arrests in Santa Clara County , has the city 's spending on gang suppression ballooned from $ 12.7 million in the 2017-18 fiscal year to $ 18.9 million in this one , while spending on youth services has only grown from $ <extra_id_99> 9 million to $ 10.3 million in the same timeframe ? It 's clear where our leaders ' priorities lie .

 TULSA , Okla. -- As supporters poured into the BOK Center for President Donald Trump 's campaign rally late Saturday afternoon , a crowd of about <extra_id_99> 100 people in support of the Black Lives Matter movement gathered a mile away at Franklin Hope Reconciliation Park to peacefully protest the rally 's timing while voicing messages of unity and racial equality .

I have to state this now ; otherwise I would probably be called a racist . Most people think that Black Lives Matter is a grass-roots , black created , black run organization dedicated to fighting racism . It most certainly is not .

Demands for police reform have taken center stage after the tragic killing -- what we consider murder -- of George Floyd by members of the Minneapolis Police Department , and other recent deaths at the hands of law enforcement . The protests sweeping our nation call out names including Breonna Taylor , Ahmaud Arbery and Rayshard Brooks . Critically important to these calls for reform are the emphatic voices of police chiefs and police unions that have expressed disgust at Floyd 's killing and sincere sorrow for his surviving family .  As chiefs of police in San Jose , San Francisco and Los Angeles , we join with the men and women of our police departments , sworn and civilian , to send <extra_id_99> one unified message : We hear you . We applaud the members of the San Jose Police Officers ' Association , San Francisco Police Officers Association and Los Angeles Police Protective League for their compassionate expressions of sorrow after the tragic events involving police officer interactions with unarmed African American residents . We salute the unions ' call for needed police reforms , denunciation of racism in policing and repudiation of racist police officers . We support their proposed first steps of reform and urge swift local and state legislative action to codify these recommendations so they carry the force of law and drive the cultural shift that can achieve lasting social change in law enforcement .  title: Opinion: After George Floyd protests, police chiefs say, “We hear you”	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Gascon 's campaign , which was largely funded in the primary by outside contributions from a pair of wealthy Northern California donors , has seen a spike of interest since the protests started . He 's got 200 new volunteers and raised over $ 160,000 , mostly in donations averaging $ 20 , according to his campaign . Lacey , who got most of her primary support indirectly from police unions , has criticized Gascon for not prosecuting police for shootings during his time as San Francisco DA , though his spokesman , Max Szabo , said none of those cases involved unarmed suspects .  The union representing Los Angeles Police Department officers spent $ <extra_id_99> 1 million to torpedo Gascon in the primary as a `` con man '' and failed leader who fled San Francisco before his term expired . He 's been criticized for authoring a law that reduced some felonies to misdemeanors , not charging enough misdemeanor cases and for a steep rise in San Francisco property crimes , mostly car break-ins . Violent crime in San Francisco during his tenure rose 15 % , though it jumped 31 % in Los Angeles County during most of Lacey 's time in office , according to a Los Angeles Times analysis . Lacey points to her record prosecuting two dozen officers for unlawful use of force and for currently being the only DA in the state to have a case pending against an officer in a killing -- a manslaughter charge against a sheriff 's deputy .  title: Black Lives Matter wants to oust first Black Los Angeles DA	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>
Leadership within the movement is decentralized . But Cullors , who serves as chair of the BLM Global Network Foundation , the group 's international arm , assists her hometown chapter when needed .

MINNEAPOLIS -- To patrol a smoldering city in the two weeks after George Floyd 's death , Minneapolis shelled out more than $ 3.3 million in police overtime costs -- roughly 37 times more than normal , pushing the department past its annual budget .  The state 's largest police force tapped 822 of its <extra_id_99> 855 sworn officers to pull extended shifts during that pay period since May 25 , where the department averaged more than 3,600 overtime hours per day , according to a Minneapolis Star Tribune analysis of payroll data . `` It was all hands on deck , '' police spokesman John Elder said of the riots that engulfed south Minneapolis in May . `` We had people working 18 and 20 hours a day .

But if there is no extra revenue to cover the difference , the city will likely turn to its rainy day fund -- a $ 40 million reserve of unobligated general fund cash , of which leaders are already borrowing $ 8 million to balance the budget . `` It 's messy , to be sure , '' Intermill said . `` But there are a number of paths we can go down to make sure expenses are covered at year-end .

Some of those cuts affected the Minneapolis Police Department , which was initially slated to have a roughly $ 193 million budget for 2020 . Elected officials estimated in late July that they had saved roughly $ 8.6 million of that when they implemented a citywide hiring and wage freeze . Around that same time , in their first major budget negotiations following George Floyd 's death , the mayor and council agreed to cut another $ 1.5 million from the department 's budget , much of which got moved to the Office of Violence Prevention .  title: Minneapolis paid more than $3.3 million in police overtime in wake of George Floyd's death	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

The use of `` less than lethal force '' such as rubber bullets and tear gas against peaceful protesters -- some of whom are teenagers and children -- is unnecessarily terrible in itself , but aggression against reporters and legal observers is an act against freedom of the press . The President insists that the violence is the fault of the protesters who smashed windows and looted buildings in June . Interestingly , he conveniently ignores the fact that those people , by video documentation and admissions , were proven to actually be undercover cops and white supremacists hijacking the true purpose of the movement -- to give a voice to those who demand justice .  In spite of , or perhaps in sympathy with , a disastrously ignorant and racist President , state governments have been slow to respond to and act on the demands of the <extra_id_99> hundreds of thousands of protesters , leaving the budgets of police departments as overinflated as usual and keeping qualified immunity for the officers in place . However , some states like Colorado have taken appropriate measures to begin the reconstruction of the inherently racist police systems , such as passing a bill to end qualified immunity in relation to state constitutional claims , according to Forbes . Other states like Virginia have bills being considered to do the same , and to end no-knock police raids -- one of which caused the senseless and horrific murder of 26-year-old EMT Breonna Taylor , while she slept in her home , in March . Major cities such as Portland are still in the midst of major protests and clashes with the police , protestors unwavered by the passing of time or pressures from opposing groups .  title: BLM Movement calls for justice against murderous police	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

According to Mr Stinson 's data , when an officer is actually convicted , it 's often on a lesser charge . For example , only five officers tracked by Mr Stinson 's data have been convicted of murder . Of those five officers , they were incarcerated for times that ranged from 81 months to 192 months in prison , with an average length prison sentence of 144.6 months .  `` As to the other officers , 11 were convicted of manslaughter , five were convicted of voluntary manslaughter , <extra_id_99> six were convicted of involuntary manslaughter , three were convicted of official misconduct , two were convicted of reckless homicide , three were convicted of negligent homicide , five were convicted of federal criminal deprivation of civil rights - including four officers whose murder convictions were overturned - one was convicted of aggravated assault , and one was convicted of reckless discharge of a firearm , '' Mr Stinson said . In addition to the public 's sympathy for the police , there 's another factor that contributes to the extremely small number of murder charges faced by officers ; murder is a tough charge to make stick . Dr David Thomas , a professor of forensic psychology at Florida Golf Coast University and a 20-year retired police officer said that murder charges are extremely difficult to levy against police officers because investigators must establish premeditation . `` It 's very difficult [ to charge someone with murder ] because you have to prove there 's premeditation , and in this instance you 'd never be able to prove there was premeditation .  title: Derek Chauvin: Despite murder charge, FBI inquiry could be more serious for ex-officers in George Floyd killing, experts say	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Floyd 's death and footage of his neck pinned under the officer 's knee have unleashed protests and violent clashes with law enforcement -- exposing simmering frustration and the fact that there 's much work still ahead , several advocates and leaders told the Associated Press . `` Progress and change can ebb and flow , '' said Jeremiah Ellison , who won a City Council seat after participating in past protests against police killings of African Americans in Minnesota . The four nights of unrest this week -- including the torching of a police station that officers abandoned -- `` proved to me that we 've regressed to the point of 2015 , '' Ellison said , referring to the year that also saw protests after the death of Jamar Clark , a black man killed by police .

It is one of the most segregated cities in the country for its size , and schools suffer from stubborn achievement gaps . The city appointed its first black chief of police nearly three years ago , after slow progress toward making the department more inclusive . Earlier this year , a statewide task force made up of activists , people representing victims of police brutality , and law enforcement leaders released recommendations for policing reforms .  title: Before George Floyd’s death, Minneapolis black activists saw progress on police reforms	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman , announcing Chauvin 's arrest , said the investigation into Chauvin , who faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted , was ongoing and he anticipated also charging the three other police officers , identified by the city as Thomas Lane , Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng .  <extra_id_99> Thousands of chanting protesters filled the streets of New York City 's Brooklyn borough near the Barclays Center indoor arena .

But that 55 percent majority is lower than it was just a month ago , when a Post-Schar School poll found 69 percent of Americans - asked specifically about Floyd 's killing - said that episode was a sign of broader problems in the treatment of police . The change has been sharply partisan . In 2014 , about two-thirds of Democrats along with roughly 4 in 10 independents said deaths were the result of broader , not isolated , problems .  Just under 2 in <extra_id_99> 10 Republicans agreed . Last month , soon after Floyd 's killing , concerns about broader police mistreatment rose by more than 20 points among each partisan group from six years ago - including almost to half of Republicans . Today , attitudes among Democrats are close to where they were last month , and while the percentages among independents have slipped , a majority of them continues to share this view . But concerns among Republicans have dropped 26 points since June and are now much closer to the roughly 2 in 10 level where they were in 2014 .  title: Poll shows Americans support Black Lives Matter but resist shifts of police funds or removal of statues	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

During a hearing on Tuesday , Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill said his July 9 order banning parties from speaking publicly about the case and restricting access to case records `` did n't work '' as intended .

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin , 44 , was charged with second-degree murder after he pinned his knee into Floyd 's neck on May 25 when he and the <extra_id_99> three other former policemen were arresting Floyd in a Minneapolis neighborhood .

MINNEAPOLIS -- Prosecutors in the case against the four former Minneapolis police officers charged in the killing of George Floyd have asked the presiding judge to reconsider his order allowing their upcoming trial to be recorded and livestreamed .  In a <extra_id_99> two page motion filed Monday , Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank asked Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill to revisit his Nov. 4 order allowing audio and video coverage of trial scheduled for March . The state objected to such coverage in July , but did not provide an explanation as to why . Citing immense global interest in the case , limited courthouse space and restricted public movements because of the COVID-19 pandemic , Cahill wrote in the historic order that the `` only way to vindicate the defendants ' constitutional right to a public trial and the media 's and public 's constitutional rights of access to criminal trials is to allow audio and video coverage of the trial . '' The live broadcast of a high-profile trial in a Minnesota state court is without precedent and the decision was greeted with enthusiasm by the media and First Amendment lawyers who say it is both welcome and overdue .  title: State asks judge to reconsider allowing audio and video coverage of officers' trial in George Floyd killing	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Despite the progress -- or alongside progress -- California , the blue bastion , remains in some ways rigidly conservative . Voters defeated the proposed repeal of affirmative action at public universities , and refused to modify Prop 13 , the so-called `` third rail '' of California politics that has limited local property tax revenue and hamstrung communities of color for 40 years . And the `` blue wave '' of 2018 that famously overtook Orange County receded a bit as Republicans regained two congressional seats there .  Still , <extra_id_99> two statewide initiatives that BLM supported or opposed , respectively -- Prop 17 , which restores voting rights to parolees , and Prop 20 , which sought to overturn some criminal justice reforms approved by voters two years ago -- went BLM 's way . The takeaway of 2020 is that anti-racism is emerging as a new rail of California politics , a fact reflected in a survey earlier this year by the Public Policy Institute of California that found two-thirds of the state 's voters expressing support for Black Lives Matter . More than a growing political movement , it 's at heart a moral idea that , against many odds and in many ways , is aligning with all our lives .  title: Black Lives Matter as Electoral Powerhouse	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_9>

Black Lives Matter-LA filed has filed a federal lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department and its chief , alleging the recent mass detention of more than 2,600 protesters , held handcuffed on buses without access to bathroom facilities , water or food , was a violation of their constitutional rights The class-action complaint , filed in Los Angeles federal court , alleges excessive force and civil rights violations against the so-called George Floyd Solidarity protesters .

Besides the pandemic , there is also the shibboleth of `` free speech '' and debate that so many in Oxford bring up as reasons to keep Rhodes where he is .

NFL free agent Michael Bennett , a longtime advocate in the fight against racial inequality , is calling out the NFL for its stance on the Black Lives Matter movement . In an interview with the Daily Beast , the three-time Pro Bowl defensive end said the NFL 's efforts to support player protests and causes ca n't erase the fact that many team owners have supported President Trump . `` If you 're supporting him , then your letter is really null and void , '' Bennett said in regard to team statements and a video apology by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in the wake of George Floyd 's death .  According to multiple reports , at least <extra_id_99> eight NFL team owners collectively donated close to $ 8 million to Trump 's inaugural committee in 2016 .

Unlike predecessors that often fell on the swords of their figureheads , this movement remains impervious to the accountability of a leader , because there are many .

The difficulty in raising criticism or calling for scrutiny of the movement , despite pulling in unimaginable revenue and endorsement from the biggest corporates , biggest names and most prominent political appeasers , is that it leaves the accuser open to being censored and attacked as a racist . As the movement establishes organised chapters across the West , is emboldened to make explicit commitments to extreme forms of socialism and anarchy , and generates a head of steam against the very structures and protections that have guarded Western society for decades , if all opposition is silenced and checks and balances swept aside , reversing a nascent tidal wave of mob rule will take significant and disturbing levels of force .  title: Make no mistake – BLM is a radical neo-Marxist political movement	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_8>

McCarty 's Assembly Bill 1185 was partly inspired by Sacramento Sheriff Scott Jones , who attempted to locked out an inspector general appointed to investigate the death of Mikel McIntyre , an unarmed Black man shot on Highway 50 in May 2017 . Flagging problematic officers Assembly Bill 1299 would require a law enforcement agency to alert the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training if the officer resigns or is terminated during a misconduct investigation . The department then would have to complete its review and follow up with additional details of the findings , creating records that would be disclosed if an officer tries to find another job in law enforcement .  The Senate passed the measure on a bipartisan , <extra_id_99> 39-0 vote , and the Assembly followed up with a 76-0 vote . Another proposal , Assembly Bill 846 , would require departments to include in their evaluations of prospective officers any bias against demographics like race , gender , sexual orientation or religion .

SB776 would make public all investigations involving <extra_id_99> an officer using force , committing sexual assault , lying on the job , or discriminating against someone , and findings of wrongful arrests and searches . Though police unions raise concerns of privacy rights , Skinner said her bill offers a way for communities to hold their departments accountable . `` The most important thing is we need to restore trust , '' she said . `` This openness will help to build that trust .

Marchers and protesters have honored Floyd , as well Breonna Taylor , a Black woman who was shot and killed by Louisville police after they entered her home while she was sleeping . Protesters are also remembering local Black people killed by police , like Antwon Rose II , a 17-year-old who was shot and killed by police in 2018 in East Pittsburgh as he was fleeing .

Initially , police arrested many people on the same days of the region 's <extra_id_99> two largest protests : May 30 in Downtown and June 1 in East Liberty . But they have also followed up and filed or sought charges days , and sometimes several weeks later , against several additional protesters , some charged for throwing water bottles .

Allegheny County Councilors , even Democrats , are still largely backing police priorities over the demands of advocates . Nine Democrats joined three Republicans to reject a county bill that would have banned police from using `` less lethal '' weapons like tear gas and sponge rounds . The bill failed by a 12-3 vote .  Allegheny County Councilor Nick Futules -LRB- D-Oakmont -RRB- spoke in opposition to the bill in July , and he said police officers needed the `` less lethal '' weapons and accused protesters of participating in an `` onslaught '' in East Liberty , in reference to the events of June 1 that resulted in all <extra_id_99> 22 arrested protesters having their charges dropped and the city being sued by at least six protesters for the police 's actions . County Council also still has n't created a county-wide police review board , and the bill to create a review board failed last year .

Host Mark Levin , in what appeared to be a choreographed effort , cited a report by an ultra-right think tank on the loosely organized protest group Antifa ( antifascist ) . The Gatestone Institute , which sponsors brazenly Islamophobic `` research , '' was chaired until 2018 by John Bolton , who then joined the Trump administration as national security adviser . The Gatestone report cites material produced by the Verfassungschutz , the German secret service agency that has placed the German Trotskyists of the Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei ( SGP -- Socialist Equality Party ) on its surveillance list , while giving its stamp of approval to the Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , the principal vehicle for the revival of neo-Nazi trends in Germany .  The report presents Antifa as a large , well-organized international conspiracy of tens of <extra_id_99> thousands of militants , although it is invariably described by supporters as little more than a signboard used by anarchists and other protesters in different localities , who communicate through social media but do not constitute an organization in any real sense of the term . Barr hailed the Gatestone report -- which quotes his own comments about Antifa -- and launched into a diatribe against Antifa . `` They are a revolutionary group that is interested in some form of socialism , communism , '' he said . `` They 're essentially Bolsheviks .

Mr Floyd 's death sparked protests in every state across the US in opposition to police brutality and racial injustice , with demonstrations still continuing in some states this month . The Pew Research Centre survey also found that those who said that they strongly supported the movement had decreased from 38 per cent in June , to 29 per cent in September . Since June , police have clashed with demonstrators at some BLM protests , and there have been various reports of violence , vandalism and looting , but a recent study found that a majority of the demonstrations have been conducted peacefully and without incident .  The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project -LRB- ACLED -RRB- analysed more than 7,750 BLM protests across the US , and found that <extra_id_99> 93 per cent of the demonstrations were peaceful , according to Time . Despite the toppling of statues and vandalism being counted as part of the project 's report , the analysis only found 220 instances of violent protests between May and September . However , Donald Trump , other high profile Republicans and Fox News hosts have criticised the movement over the last few months , highlighting incidents of violence and vandalism at protests across the country . The PEW survey found that the amount of white Republicans who said they either strongly or somewhat supported BLM decreased the most of any group , from 37 per cent in June to just 16 per cent in September .  title: Poll shows major decline in support for BLM movement across US over last three months	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

The Trump administration has given no indication of whether it will do a new roundup of Bundy 's cattle or allow the animals to graze freely on public lands , amounting to what one observer called a `` free pass '' for the rancher to continue to buck the federal government as he has for 20 years . `` This so-called law-and-order administration will always ignore the law to help their friends , '' said Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss . `` So it 's no surprise [ Interior Secretary David ] Bernhardt and his cronies all look the other way as an anti-government extremist like Bundy illegally runs his cattle over the fragile Nevada landscape and illegally runs water lines across the desert .

The other three former officers -- J. Alexander Kueng , Thomas Lane and Tou Thao -- are also seeking dismissal of the charges against them . But prosecutors say the former officers should all face lengthy sentences if convicted , arguing in their own court filing that Floyd was `` particularly vulnerable '' to harm because he was handcuffed and officers allegedly treated Floyd with `` particular cruelty '' as he claimed he had trouble breathing in the minutes prior to his death , FOX 9 reported . Last week , a Hennepin County medical examiner 's report said the amount of fentanyl in Floyd 's body was `` pretty high , '' and could be considered `` a fatal level of fentanyl under normal circumstances .

If America is so insufferably racist , how is it that Lester Holt anchors `` The NBC Nightly News ? '' How does Don Lemon host a CNN program every evening ?

We tend to think about them physically first and foremost , like the fact that this cancer is now out of their body , that 's something to celebrate . And that is something to celebrate , but the life that once was is no longer . There 's a new life and that takes a lot of recalibration , making peace with and letting go of the past and embracing what is the present while you move boldly into the future .  And so , I think <extra_id_99> one of the biggest things that I take away from the whole experience is that you have to let people be where they are ; you ca n't force them to be happier even if you think they should be . They 're happy , they 're grateful , but they 're also learning how to mourn what was as they embrace what is . I think the more that we accept people where they are , the more they 'll share with us their experience . Instead of trying to force them into putting on a brave face and being something that they 're not , allowing them to be their full selves .  title: Sterling K.

Rather than a completely blackened face , Soot Petes have a face streaked with lines of chimney ash -- supposedly caused by their climbing through the sooty chimneys to deliver gifts . It is the only variation of Pete that is acceptable to Kick Out Black Pete , the Dutch activist organization founded in 2014 to end any racially offensive representation of the character . In a representative national poll from November , opposition to replacing Black Pete with Soot Pete decreased from 66 % to 43 % .  And only <extra_id_99> 19 % thought that Black Pete would still exist in 10 years ' time . However , this is only part of the story .

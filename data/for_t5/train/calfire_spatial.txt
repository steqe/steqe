California has lost far more landscape to wildfires this summer than during any previous entire year , with scores of conflagrations , many sparked by catastrophic lightning storms , scorching about 3.4 million acres since mid-August .

Another 2 million acres have gone up in flames in Oregon and Washington state during an overlapping outbreak of wildfires that started earlier this month , destroying more than 4,400 structures in all and claiming 10 lives .

Sep. 14 , 2020 4:30 PM SACRAMENTO , Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom had President Donald Trump one-on-one on live TV Monday , a perfect opportunity to spar with Democrats ' public enemy No. 1 just 50 days before the election .  But Newsom dropped the fiery tone he has employed in recent weeks about climate change and its role in <extra_id_99> five of the largest fires California has ever seen . Instead , he engaged the president in a respectful conversation that included both men hailing their good relationship . Just last week , Newsom declared he had `` no patience for climate-change deniers , '' saying people must `` disabuse ourselves of all the BS that 's being spewed by a very small group of people . '' On Monday , Newsom told Trump they `` can agree to disagree '' on climate change and asked him to `` please respect ... the difference of opinion out here .

As crews battled wildfires that have killed at least 35 people , destroyed neighborhoods and enveloped the West Coast in smoke , Trump contended that the states are to blame for failing to rake leaves and clear dead timber from forest floors . However , many of the California blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands , not forest , and some of the largest are burning on federal land . In Oregon , it was the forests that burned at unprecedented levels this past week .  Almost the same number of `` megafires '' -- defined as having scorched <extra_id_99> 100,000 acres or more -- were burning last week as have occurred during the entire last century , said Jim Gersbach , spokesman for the Oregon Department of Forestry . Experts , environmentalists and loggers largely agree that thinning trees and brush through prescribed burns and careful logging will help prevent forests that cover vast tracts of the American West from threatening cities with fire . But whether that would have spared towns is less clear . Strong winds sent flames racing down the western slopes of the Cascade Range into small towns like Detroit , Oregon , wiping them out . title: Easing fires not as simple as climate change vs. forest work	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> Oregon <extra_id_4> </s>

But as the wildfires rage , some climate activists have expressed frustration that Biden has not been more forceful on the issue . He has not embraced , for instance , some of the most progressive elements of the Green New Deal . To that end , Biden in his address did not wade into political and policy disagreements among Democrats , progressive activists and even some Republicans who acknowledge the climate crisis . title: Trump spurns science on climate change: ‘I don’t think science knows’ (video)	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> <extra_id_4> </s> </s>

Since 2000 , large fires sparked by lightning have burned more acreage than those caused by humans . This makes sense .

The heat and winds have been leading to extreme wildfire behavior that makes controlling the fires nearly impossible . On Saturday , fire tornadoes were observed with the Loyalton Fire in Lassen County , Calif. , between Reno , Nev. , and Lake Tahoe . The LNU Lightning Complex fire progressed about three miles to the southeast in just an hour and a half early Wednesday , forcing firefighters and first responders to scramble .  As the fire advanced , a PG&E weather station recorded a temperature spike to <extra_id_99> 114 degrees , indicative of heat coming from the blaze . Many of these fires were sparked by lightning strikes after an unusual line of storms swept into the Bay Area and moved inland Sunday , while other storms featuring dry lightning , which occurs when thunderstorms produce little to no rainfall , sparked still more fires . The scope of the fires facing California is unusually broad , with blazes burning in Monterey County , near the Oroville Dam north of Sacramento , near the Nevada state line as well as the northern coastal areas and southern parts of the state .

Wildfires burning from Wine Country to the Peninsula are forcing thousands to evacuate and threatening as many homes .

By Sunday afternoon , this news organization mapped at least <extra_id_99> 14 lightning-sparked fires across the Bay Area . Smoke from a series of fires hung over the region early Wednesday , bringing a smoky smell and hazy skies and leading the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to issue a Spare the Air alert through Thursday .

: Overnight Evacuations In Vacaville As Lightning-Sparked Fires Spread Across Bay Area Californians have been asked to conserve energy once again as a heat wave continues to pummel the West Coast . CA ISO , which manages the state 's power grid , has issued a Flex Alert for 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday , starting one hour earlier than previous alerts .  The agency said conservation efforts this week have allowed the state to largely avoid massive rolling blackouts , which at one point threatened to leave <extra_id_99> 3.3 million homes in the dark . `` With temperatures forecast above-normal again today , operators are expecting demand on the system to come in high , particularly in the mid-afternoon hours , '' said CA ISO in a statement .

1 of 3 BOISE , Idaho -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often crews are forced to use them during wildfires . `` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday . `` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate .

They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees of heat for about a minute . The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure . The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said . title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives but raise questions	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> <extra_id_4> </s> </s>

PG&E said it received more than 130 reports of damage or hazards to its equipment . Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable . October and November are traditionally the worst months for fires , but already this year 8,600 wildfires in the state have scorched a record 6,400 square miles ( 16,600 square kilometers ) and destroyed about 9,200 homes , businesses and other buildings .  There have been <extra_id_99> 31 deaths . When the Orange County fires broke out Monday morning , Edison had only cut power to 30 customers in the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles . As of Tuesday night , only about 2,000 of Edison 's 5 million customers were without power , according to an outage website . A study by the Manhattan Institute last year found that PG&E was far more likely to institute emergency shutoffs -- and cut off power to far more people -- than Edison in Southern California . title: Utility: Winds too weak to cut power before California fire	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>
By contrast , in the past few years California intentionally burned roughly 50 thousand acres on public lands . In fact , a study published in the journal Fire showed that prescribed burns on federal lands in the West over the past 20 years stayed flat or fell despite ongoing calls to do much more . ` Losing this battle every year ' Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) was the only federal agency to substantially increase prescribed fire use , the study said , likely due to tribal self-governance and a historic embrace of intentional fire .  Federal and California officials recently signed an agreement to try boost that significantly : the new goal is to treat about <extra_id_99> 1 million acres a year with combined thinning and controlled burns . But experts warn that states continue to set ambitions prescribed fire goals they never reach . And critics say that new goal is nowhere near enough to meet this moment . `` It 's not something in which incremental , cautious decisions are going to solve the problem , '' says Malcolm North , an outspoken research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who has long advocated for more controlled burns . title: Experts To Western States: Time To Finally Fight Wildfires With More Fire	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

2020 was n't normal , but what is normal ? If 2020 has proved anything , it is to expect the unexpected .

It would be exorbitantly expensive to build enough power plants to ensure the electricity never goes off -- and some of those plants might sit idle for years at a time . So instead , the U.S. utility industry has long followed a standard of having enough power on call to ensure this type of outage does n't happen more than once every 10 years . The last time California was forced to implement rotating blackouts because of insufficient energy supply was nearly 20 years ago , during the 2001 energy crisis , as opposed to more recent intentional outages because of fire safety .  But these blackouts may strike a raw nerve for many PG&E customers after the utility 's decision last year to shut down power to <extra_id_99> millions of people in an effort to prevent its aging and poorly maintained transmission lines from igniting wildfires . In a letter to his own top energy officials Monday , Gov. Gavin Newsom described the blackouts as `` unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation 's largest and most innovative state . '' He instructed them to investigate what had gone wrong and take several steps to better prepare for future heat waves . title: California blackouts are Public Utilities Commission's fault, grid operator says	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

Homeowners in fire-prone areas of California have had it rough in recent years . Not only have they been threatened by gigantic , climate-change-fueled wildfires , but their insurance premiums have skyrocketed -- if they have n't been dumped by insurers worried about huge claims from the blazes that will inevitably come .  Over the course of four particularly bad fire years , from 2015 to 2018 , more than <extra_id_99> 340,000 homeowners in rural areas were told by insurers their policies would not be renewed , according to the California Department of Insurance . Those unable to find another insurance company willing to write a new policy have been left with the high-cost option of last resort , the California FAIR plan . It 's a bad situation -- and it could get even worse if lawmakers approve Assembly Bill 2167 , a legislative `` fix '' championed by the insurance industry that purports to improve coverage in areas of high fire risk . But the only thing that 's likely to improve under these proposed changes is the bottom line of insurance companies , say California 's Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara and consumer advocates , including the author of Proposition 103 , the landmark consumer protection law regulating property and casualty insurance rates in California . title: Guest Editorial: An insurance fix that only insurers could love	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

By stamping out smaller fires and those that ignite during wetter months , Stahl said officials have allowed fuels to build up , setting the stage for bigger fires during times of drought and hot , windy weather . That 's been exacerbated this year by the coronavirus pandemic , which prompted U.S. Forest Service Chief Vickie Christiansen to issue a directive in June to fight all fires aggressively , reversing a decades-long trend of allowing some to burn . The idea was to minimize large concentrations of firefighters by extinguishing blazes quickly .

Even in areas that are untouched by the fires themselves , the rippling effects of these fires can and have been felt far and wide . California 's wildfire season has caused increased pollutants that raise the Air Quality Index in past years , such as the Kincaide fire of 2019 , which caused AQI levels of 150 or more . However , the combination of fires this year , both in state and out of state , have sparked unprecedented highs .  Many areas are averaging an AQI of <extra_id_99> 200 , and several areas , such as Sacramento , are reaching numbers of 400 or higher . According to Airnow , a government partner of the EPA dedicated to monitoring Air Quality , 200 + AQI is classified as `` Very Unhealthy '' and they warn that the chance for adverse health effects from exposure is higher for everyone . Areas that have reached the level of 300 + AQI are labelled as dangerous health conditions , which have far more pronounced effects on the health of all people in that area .

WASHINGTON -- The number of wildfires and the amount of land they consume in the western U.S. has substantially increased since the 1980s , a trend often attributed to ongoing climate change . Now , new research finds fires are not only becoming more common in the western U.S. but the area burned at high severity is also increasing , a trend that may lead to long-term forest loss . The new findings show warmer temperatures and drier conditions are driving an eight-fold increase in annual area burned by high severity fire across western forests from 1985-2017 .  In total , annual area burned by high severity wildfires -- defined as those that kill more than 95 % of trees -- increased by more than <extra_id_99> 450,000 acres . `` As more area burns at high severity , the likelihood of conversion to different forest types or even to non-forest increases , '' said Sean Parks , a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station and lead author of the new study . `` At the same time , the post-fire climate is making it increasingly difficult for seedlings to establish and survive , further reducing the potential for forests to return to their pre-fire condition .

 ALERTWildfire reaches 610-camera milestone during season of record fires As California reacts to a record-breaking 2020 fire season , a backcountry observation network has reached a milestone of installing more than <extra_id_99> 610 cameras across the state . The cameras are part of the ALERTWildfire camera network , built by UC San Diego 's Scripps Institution of Oceanography , the University of Nevada , Reno and the University of Oregon .

When UC San Diego and the University of Oregon became partners , the network became ALERTWildfire . The efficacy of the network to confirm and monitor wildfires was readily apparent and interagency investment created a surge in camera numbers as they quickly became an essential tool . In California , the ALERTWildfire network expansion began in 2017 with 16 cameras in San Diego County funded through San Diego Gas & Electric .  From there , additional investment and support to expand the network has come from organizations including Pacific Gas & Electric , Southern California Edison , and most recently CAL FIRE , which contributed $ <extra_id_99> 5 million for the installation and network support of 100 additional cameras throughout the state of California that were installed this spring , summer and fall in anticipation of a potentially dangerous 2020 fire season . `` The ALERTWildfire camera network provides actionable real-time data that allows first responders to marshal resources to fight fires in the incipient phase , '' said Scripps Oceanography geoscientist Neal Driscoll , director of the ALERTWildfire program at UC San Diego . `` These cameras save critical time by allowing rapid confirmation of 911 calls and accurate location of new fires using the ALERTWildfire web-based interface , time that would otherwise be spent sending engines to mountaintops or launching aircraft to confirm fire ignition and location .

About <extra_id_99> 13,700 firefighters are manning the lines , said Daniel Berlant , assistant deputy director for Cal Fire . Fire crews have been working around the clock and resources are drained . Only 1,400 firefighters were battling a blaze in California 's wine country , north of the San Francisco Bay . By comparison , the state had 5,000 firefighters assigned to the Mendocino Complex in 2018 , which still holds the record as the largest fire in state history . title: More lightning strikes?

Wildfire is threatening parts of the San Francisco Bay Area , the forested region near the University of California at Santa Cruz and a wide swath of the area between San Francisco and the state capital of Sacramento . On Saturday , President Donald Trump declared the fires to be a major disaster , the White House said . The declaration , which allows federal funds to be used to help people and businesses harmed by the fires in seven counties to pay for temporary housing , home repairs and other needs , came despite a threat from Trump earlier this week to withhold aid from California .  Nearly <extra_id_99> 14,000 firefighters have been deployed to the blazes , but containment of the largest ones remains low and the state has requested additional support from other states and local jurisdictions in California , Cal Fire said Saturday . `` They 're scrambling for bodies '' to help fight the fires , said Jay Tracy , a fire marshal with the city of Fresno who was deployed as a spokesman for the LNU fire complex , which had burned 314,000 acres in five counties , including some of the state 's storied wine country and communities between San Francisco and Sacramento . Firefighters have improved containment of the southern edge of that fire , but winds are expected to push it northwest toward the wine country towns of Healdsburg and Guernville , he said . Local agencies like his are limited in how many reinforcements they can send to help state firefighters because many are still needed at home , while the sheer volume of fires burning in the state have stretched resources , Tracy said . title: 14,000 Firefighters Deployed to Battle Growing, Lightning-Sparked NorCal Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California <extra_id_4> </s>

( SAN FRANCISCO ) -- A calm overnight allowed firefighters to make progress against a trio of massive wildfires burning in Northern California but they were girding for a weather system Sunday that will bring high winds and thunderstorms that could spark new fires and fan existing blazes that destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands to evacuate .

University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West .

SACRAMENTO , Calif. -- When it comes to California wildfires , it now takes days , not decades , to produce what had been seen as a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence . Last weekend , a fire burning in California 's Sierra National Forest exploded in size , trapping hundreds of Labor Day holiday campers who could only be rescued by helicopters that made a series of white-knuckle flights into the smoke . Fire officials said they 'd never seen a fire move so fast in forestland -- 15 miles ( 24 kilometers ) in a day .  On Wednesday , a wildfire in Plumas National Forest northeast of San Francisco spread 25 miles -LRB- <extra_id_99> 40 kilometers -RRB- in a day and devoured an estimated 400 square miles -LRB- 1,036 square kilometers -RRB- , In between those events , a massive fire in Monterey County doubled in size overnight , trapping 14 firefighters who had to deploy their emergency shelters ; one was critically injured . They are only the latest examples of what a half-dozen fire experts agreed is more extreme fire behavior driven by drought and warming temperatures they attribute to climate change . Among the most concerning developments is that fast-moving wildfires leave less time for warnings or evacuations . Recently `` we have seen multiple fires expand by tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours , and 30 years or more ago that just was n't fire behavior that we saw , '' said Jacob Bendix , a professor of geography and the environment at Syracuse University who studies wildfires . title: California wildfires growing bigger, moving faster than ever	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California San Francisco </s>

University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West . The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy , which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume , `` creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm , '' Flannigan said . The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus , which may or may not produce lightning , and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze .  An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented `` firenado , '' killing <extra_id_99> a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding . Yet just this month a fire north of Lake Tahoe spun off at least two and as many as four firenadoes , while the Plumas National Forest fire appears to have produced `` a handful '' overnight Tuesday , said Neil Lareau , a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Nevada , Reno . The Creek Fire produced at least two firenadoes that appeared to touch down Saturday , he said , one straddling an access road to a popular campground at Mammoth Pool Reservoir where 214 people became trapped . `` It 's really kind of a testament to the remarkable extremes that we 're seeing right now , '' Lareau said . title: California Wildfires Are Growing Bigger And Moving Faster Than Ever	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> California Redding </s>

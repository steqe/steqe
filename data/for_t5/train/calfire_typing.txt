Firstly , the high temperatures fuelled an outbreak of wildfires in the Arctic Circle . Images captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission show some of the fires in the Chukotka region , the most north-easterly region of Russia , on 23 June 2020 . Wildfire smoke releases a wide range of pollutants including carbon monoxide , nitrogen oxides and solid aerosol particles .  In June alone , the Arctic wildfires were reported to have emitted the equivalent of <extra_id_99> 56 megatonnes of carbon dioxide , as well as significant amounts of carbon monoxide and particulate matter . These wildfires affect radiation , clouds and climate on a regional , and global , scale . The Arctic heatwave also contributes to the thawing of permafrost . Arctic permafrost soils contain large quantities of organic carbon and materials left over from dead plants that can not decompose or rot , whereas permafrost layers deeper down contain soils made of minerals .  title: Monitoring the Arctic heatwave	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
More than a week after a trio of historic wildfires around the Bay Area prompted their first evacuation orders , some residents got the OK to return home Thursday , and more approvals were on the horizon .

The fires in these regions have also been exacerbated by heat and drought conditions made worse by climate change , scientists say . `` What we 're seeing with fires in California and elsewhere around the world is that fire is really responsive to climate change , '' said Jennifer Balch , a fire ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder . That is bad news for temperate and boreal forests , which unlike tropical forests such as the Amazon have evolved over millennia to need occasional fire outbreaks for their own renewal , scientists say .  Whether these woodlands can survive more intense wildfire scenarios will depend on <extra_id_99> two key issues -- how frequently the fires come , and how hot they burn . `` TREE-TORCHING '' IN THE U.S. WEST This year 's deadly fires in the United States had devoured a record of nearly 5 million acres as of Sunday , a scale of devastation that fits into the longer-term trend of more acreage being scorched as temperatures rise . Historically , fires in the region tended to burn low to the ground , eliminating dead conifer limbs , keeping competing species in check and prompting pine cones to open and disperse their seeds . These days , fire crews are seeing increasing cases of massive `` tree-torching '' fires that engulf forests from the ground up through the canopy .  title: Fierce, frequent, climate-fueled wildfires may decimate forests worldwide	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
LOS ANGELES - Five weeks after California erupted in deadly wildfires supercharged by record heat and howling winds , crews battling flames pushed Monday to consolidate their gains before the return of the blistering , gusty weather . California has lost far more landscape to wildfires this summer than during any previous entire year , with scores of conflagrations , many sparked by catastrophic lightning storms , scorching about 3.4 million acres since mid-August . The previous record was just less than 2 million acres burned in 2018 .  As of Monday , more than <extra_id_99> 19,000 firefighters continued to wage war on 27 major blazes across the state , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -LRB- CalFire -RRB- . The fires , stoked by extreme weather conditions that scientists have pointed to as signs of climate change , have destroyed an estimated 6,100 homes and other structures and killed 26 people , three of them firefighters , CalFire reported . Another 2 million acres have gone up in flames in Oregon and Washington state during an overlapping outbreak of wildfires that started earlier this month , destroying more than 4,400 structures in all and claiming 10 lives . But a weekend of intermittently heavy showers across the western Cascade mountain range helped fire crews in the Pacific Northwest tamp down blazes in those two states .  title: California Firefighters Race to Subdue Flames Before Heat, Winds Return	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>
The break in the weather is not expected to last much longer . Tolmachoff said forecasts call for rising temperatures , lower humidity and a return of strong , erratic winds around midweek in Southern California and by the weekend across the state 's northern half . Bobcat Fire proves stubborn Some fires have proved more stubborn than others .  One in particular , dubbed the Bobcat Fire , grew to more than <extra_id_99> 100,000 acres Monday in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles , with containment levels achieved by firefighters holding steady at just 15 % , CalFire said . The Bobcat last week spread perilously close to a famed astronomical observatory and complex of vital communications towers at the summit of Mount Wilson , while forcing evacuations of communities in the foothills below . Several more areas , including Pasadena , a city of 140,000 people , remained under an evacuation warning , advising residents to be ready to flee at a moment 's notice . At the opposite end of the sprawling mountain range to the north , the fire was reported to have destroyed some homes and other structures in the high desert of the Antelope Valley .  title: California Firefighters Race to Subdue Flames Before Heat, Winds Return	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

In Oregon , it was the forests that burned at unprecedented levels this past week .  Almost the same number of `` megafires '' -- defined as having scorched <extra_id_99> 100,000 acres or more -- were burning last week as have occurred during the entire last century , said Jim Gersbach , spokesman for the Oregon Department of Forestry . `` Where you have lots of people living on small acreages close together , and you 've got houses and barns and sheds and corrals and fences , it 's very difficult to do a prescribed burn , '' Gersbach said . `` You 've got a lot of things that , if that fire for some reason escapes , you 're almost immediately into someone else 's property .

After such a taxing wildfire summer , could the worst possibly be yet to come ? Or will Mother Nature finally lend a relieving hand ? Financial devastations ` equivalent of what we might see for a Category 4 or 5 hurricane ' With over 6,000 homes and structures destroyed , dozens of deaths , nearly 5 million acres burnt and many millions of dry acres at risk , the totality of financial impacts dealt by wildfires in 2020 is likely to surpass the ranges expected for a typical wildfire season and veer into another eye-popping category , that of a major hurricane .

Sep. 14 , 2020 4:30 PM SACRAMENTO , Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom had President Donald Trump one-on-one on live TV Monday , a perfect opportunity to spar with Democrats ' public enemy No. 1 just 50 days before the election .  But Newsom dropped the fiery tone he has employed in recent weeks about climate change and its role in <extra_id_99> five of the largest fires California has ever seen . Instead , he engaged the president in a respectful conversation that included both men hailing their good relationship . Just last week , Newsom declared he had `` no patience for climate-change deniers , '' saying people must `` disabuse ourselves of all the BS that 's being spewed by a very small group of people . '' On Monday , Newsom told Trump they `` can agree to disagree '' on climate change and asked him to `` please respect ... the difference of opinion out here .

As crews battled wildfires that have killed at least 35 people , destroyed neighborhoods and enveloped the West Coast in smoke , Trump contended that the states are to blame for failing to rake leaves and clear dead timber from forest floors . However , many of the California blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands , not forest , and some of the largest are burning on federal land . In Oregon , it was the forests that burned at unprecedented levels this past week .  Almost the same number of `` megafires '' -- defined as having scorched <extra_id_99> 100,000 acres or more -- were burning last week as have occurred during the entire last century , said Jim Gersbach , spokesman for the Oregon Department of Forestry . Experts , environmentalists and loggers largely agree that thinning trees and brush through prescribed burns and careful logging will help prevent forests that cover vast tracts of the American West from threatening cities with fire . But whether that would have spared towns is less clear . Strong winds sent flames racing down the western slopes of the Cascade Range into small towns like Detroit , Oregon , wiping them out .  title: Easing fires not as simple as climate change vs. forest work	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
`` If by forest management he means clear-cutting , that 's absolutely the wrong solution to this problem . ... There 's no way we 're going to log our way out of this fire problem .

But as the wildfires rage , some climate activists have expressed frustration that Biden has not been more forceful on the issue . He has not embraced , for instance , some of the most progressive elements of the Green New Deal . To that end , Biden in his address did not wade into political and policy disagreements among Democrats , progressive activists and even some Republicans who acknowledge the climate crisis .  title: Trump spurns science on climate change: ‘I don’t think science knows’ (video)	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>

Hundreds of homes and structures in Grand County were threatened or destroyed , and the lakes and reservoirs there that comprise Northern 's water collection system faced the same fate . The agency serves more than 1 million people on the Front Range . Since mid-August , Northern 's team had watched the Cameron Peak Fire burning in Rocky Mountain National Park just to the north of Grand County , threatening some of Northern 's customers and watersheds , but not the heart of its collection system .  When East Troublesome exploded eight weeks later , the water utility found itself suddenly squeezed between what have now become Colorado 's two largest wildfires in recorded history , with Cameron Peak consuming <extra_id_99> 209,000 acres and East Troublesome 194,000 , before both were declared contained in November .

There was no containment of the fire . Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal , oil and gas . Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable .  The Bond Fire about 50 miles southeast of Los Angeles is burning near the same area of October 's Silverado Fire , which forced <extra_id_99> tens of thousands of people to evacuate . Kolbi Winters said helicopters flew overhead throughout the night and before dawn she got a warning she might need to evacuate her home .

Months after concluding a bankruptcy case arising from its responsibility for numerous wildfires , Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is facing new scrutiny over yet another devastating blaze .  Legal pressure has been building against PG&E as state officials investigate whether the company is responsible for the 56,338-acre Zogg Fire in Shasta and Tehama counties that killed four people and destroyed <extra_id_99> 204 buildings . It 's following an all-too-familiar pattern for PG&E , even though the cause of the fire is still unconfirmed . The company said state fire investigators seized some of its electrical equipment near the Zogg Fire 's origin point . U.S. District Judge William Alsup , who oversees the company 's probation in a deadly 2010 gas line explosion , is asking pointed questions .  title: Zogg Fire investigation puts PG&E under microscope again	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
`` PG&E is always going to face fire risk , '' he said . `` So it 's important that they have the financial and corporate governance structures in place to deal with those events . '' Alsup , the judge overseeing PG&E 's probation arising from the deadly 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion , has pressed the company for answers about its role in the Zogg Fire .  He has specifically sought to figure out the extent of PG&E 's tree-trimming work around the <extra_id_99> 12,000-volt power line that may have started the fire . In recent court filings , PG&E has said it did not know of any prescribed vegetation work that was incomplete at the time the fire began . The company said that , since mid-2015 , its contractors had trimmed or removed more than 40 trees around the three sections of power line that appear to be of interest to fire investigators . Along the entire power line circuit in question -- which spans nearly 120 miles -- crews worked on thousands of trees in the same time period , including more than 2,000 trees during a routine inspections in March and April this year , the company 's lawyers said .  title: Zogg Fire investigation puts PG&E under microscope again	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

SANTA CRUZ , Calif. ( AP ) -- Wildfires churning out dense plumes of smoke as they scorch huge swaths of the U.S. West Coast have exposed millions of people to hazardous pollution levels , causing emergency room visits to spike and potentially thousands of deaths among the elderly and infirm , according to an Associated Press analysis of pollution data and interviews with physicians , health authorities and researchers .  Smoke at concentrations that topped the government 's charts for health risks and lasted at least a day enshrouded counties inhabited by more than <extra_id_99> 8 million people across five states in recent weeks , AP 's analysis shows . Major cities in Oregon , which has been especially hard hit , last month suffered the highest pollution levels they 've ever recorded when powerful winds supercharged fires that had been burning in remote areas and sent them hurtling to the edge of densely populated Portland . Medical complications began arising while communities were still enveloped in smoke , including hundreds of additional emergency room visits daily in Oregon , according to state health officials . `` It 's been brutal for me , '' said Barb Trout , a 64-year-old retiree living south of Portland in the Willamette Valley .  title: Wildfire smoke in US exposes millions to hazardous pollution	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
Most of Johnson 's patients are expected to recover but he said some could have permanent loss of lung function . Then there are the `` hidden '' victims who Johnson suspects died from heart attacks or other problems triggered by the poor air quality but whose cause of death will be chalked up to something else . `` Many wo n't show up at the hospital or they 'll die at home or they 'll show up at hospice for other reasons , such as pneumonia or other complications , '' Johnson said .  Based on prior studies of pollution-related deaths and the number of people exposed to recent fires , researchers at Stanford University estimated that as many as <extra_id_99> 3,000 people over 65 in California alone died prematurely after being exposed to smoke during a six-week period beginning Aug. 1 . Hundreds more deaths could have occurred in Washington over several weeks of poor air caused by the fires , according to University of Washington researchers . The findings for both states have not been published in peer-reviewed journals . No such estimate was available for Oregon .  title: Wildfire smoke in US exposes millions to hazardous pollution	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

A California heat wave on Thursday prompted warnings of extreme fire danger and some precautionary powerline shutdowns . Wildfires are a regular occurrence in Western states but they 've grown more intense and dangerous as a changing climate dries out forests thick with trees and underbrush from decades of fire suppression . What makes the smoke from these fires dangerous are particles too small for the naked eye to see that can be breathed in and cause respiratory problems .  On any given day , western fires can produce <extra_id_99> 10 times more particles than are produced by all other pollution sources including vehicle emissions and industrial facilities , said Shawn Urbanski , a U.S. Forest Service smoke scientist . Fires across the West emitted more than a million tons of the particles in 2012 , 2015 and 2017 , and almost as much in 2018 -- the year a blaze in Paradise , California killed 85 people and burned 14,000 houses , generating a thick plume that blanketed portions of Northern California for weeks . Figures for 2017 and 2018 are preliminary . A confluence of meteorological events made the smoke especially bad this year : first , fierce winds up and down the coast whipped fires into a fury , followed in Oregon by a weather inversion that trapped smoke close to the ground and made it inescapable for days .  title: Wildfire smoke in US exposes millions to hazardous pollution	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

The number of fires reported in a year does n't always track with the acreage burned . Prior to 2020 , Colorado had seen an upswing of fires reported per year , though it 's unclear if this was a change in actual fire activity or in reporting patterns . Since small jurisdictions are often slow in reporting their fires , the number of fires recorded for 2020 will likely increase by the end of the year -- but it 's not clear how much those little fires will add to this year 's acreage .  title: Five charts that show where 2020 ranks in Colorado wildfire history	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
Since 2000 , large fires sparked by lightning have burned more acreage than those caused by humans . This makes sense . When lightning starts a fire in an isolated area , firefighters are apt to let it burn itself out rather than fight it aggressively , and the fire grows bigger than it might have otherwise .  This is the case with the Middle Fork fire this year , which was started by lightning and has burned nearly <extra_id_99> 20,000 acres in remote forest land north of Steamboat Springs , so far posing little threat to people or property . But the big fires that destroy things , those are usually started by people . Of the eight fires in 2020 that have burned more than 10,000 acres , three were started by lightning . Combined , those fires have destroyed only a handful of outbuildings .  title: Five charts that show where 2020 ranks in Colorado wildfire history	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

She said the tragedy should n't be called an accident . `` I hate the term accident in this case because , in my opinion , it is not an accident if you fail to operate your company safely , '' Homendy said .  title: NTSB: Lack of oversight blamed for deadly ‘Conception’ boat fire	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>

PORTLAND , Ore. ( Reuters ) - Search and rescue crews using dogs combed through neighborhoods left in blackened ruins by massive wildfires burning across three states on Saturday , and U.S. President Donald Trump said he would travel to California to see the devastation first-hand . Flames have destroyed thousands of homes and a half dozen small towns in the latest outbreak of wildfires that have raged across the western United States this summer , scorching a landscape the size of New Jersey and killing at least 26 people since early August . But after four days of brutally hot , windy weather , the weekend brought calmer winds blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean , and cooler , moister conditions that helped crews make headway against blazes that had burned unchecked earlier in the week .  At least <extra_id_99> six people have been killed this week in Oregon , according to the state 's wildfire tracking website .

PORTLAND , Ore. ( Reuters ) - Firefighters took advantage of a welcome break in hot , dry weather on Saturday to make gains against massive wildfires burning across three western states as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would travel to California to see the devastation first-hand . Flames have destroyed thousands of homes and at least half a dozen small towns in the latest outbreak of wildfires that have raged across the western United States this summer , collectively scorching a landscape the size of New Jersey and killing at least 26 people since early August . But after four days of treacherously hot , windy weather , a glimmer of hope arrived in the form of calmer winds blowing in from the ocean , bringing cooler , moister conditions that helped firefighters make headway against blazes that had burned largely unchecked earlier in the week .  At least <extra_id_99> six people have been killed this week in Oregon , according to the state 's wildfire tracking website , and Governor Kate Brown has warned that dozens of people had been reported missing in three counties . In California , tens of thousands of firefighters were battling 28 major wildfires as of Saturday morning , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection . Cooler , moister air had allowed crews to gain a measure of containment over most of the blazes . The White House said Trump , a Republican , will meet on Monday with local and federal officials near the California state capital of Sacramento on Monday .  title: Weather aids fight against massive wildfires, Trump to visit California	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

Orange skies tinted by wildfire ash loomed over Southern California on Friday as a smoke advisory was extended for at least another day .

The president 's move to repurpose disaster relief funds for unemployment , moreover , will at best complicate and lengthen the process of distributing the money to people who need it now . It 's also his latest attack on the constitutional separation of powers : Even if it makes sense to spend money Congress allocated to fire and flood relief on unemployment insurance , doing so is clearly a job for lawmakers given their authority over federal spending . So , too , is cutting taxes .  Trump 's orders at least recognized that limitation on his power , calling for a payroll tax cut but settling for a directive to suspend collection of the revenue from employees making less than $ <extra_id_99> 104,000 through the end of the year . To the extent that deferring the tax that funds Social Security and Medicare helps anyone , it will be those fortunate enough to have jobs and therefore not in the greatest need . Another of the Trump orders offers modest relief to those carrying federal student loan debt by canceling interest due for the rest of the year and allowing principal payments to be delayed . But the president stopped short of extending such relief to tens of millions of tenants who could lose their housing , ordering only that administration officials look into the matter .  title: EDITORIAL: Trump’s meager executive orders underscore need for coronavirus relief from Congress [San Francisco Chronicle]	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

And it substantially burdens the core right of self-defense guaranteed to the people under the Second Amendment . It can not stand . '' U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn dissented , stating that the law does not substantially burden Second Amendment rights because it does not prevent citizens from using `` handguns or other weapons in self-defense . ''  She wrote that `` the prohibition on LCMs is more analogous to a restriction on how someone exercises their Second Amendment rights , by restricting the number of bullets a person may shoot from <extra_id_99> one firearm without reloading . '' The ruling affirms U.S. District Judge Roger T. Benitez 's decision last year that the law violated the Second Amendment rights of gun owners and that its passage was an overreaction to high-profile gun crimes . Benitez issued his ruling in favor of several San Diego County gun owners who argued the ban burdened lawful gun owners and did little to reduce gun violence . Chuck Michel , president and general counsel of the California Rifle & Pistol Association , which represented the plaintiffs in the San Diego case , said , `` Today 's decision in Duncan v. Becerra is a major victory for the Second Amendment , both in California and across the country .  title: Court Ends California Ban On High-Capacity Magazines	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Sacramento may reach 107 degrees for the first time since Sept. 2 , 2017 , and Fresno is forecast to hit the 110-degree mark for the first time since June 20 , 2017 . Cooling centers have been opened in Sacramento to help residents stay cool amid the record heat . The scorching temperatures are a concern for firefighters battling blazes that have destroyed several homes and have erupted near both rural and urban foothill neighborhoods , driving through tinder-dry brush .  In addition to the possibility of heat stroke and other hot-weather illnesses , health officers were concerned that people will pack beaches , lakes and other recreation areas without following mask and social distancing orders -- a major concern in a state that has seen more than <extra_id_99> 590,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 11,000 deaths .

Similar gun magazine bans in other states have been upheld by other federal courts , and a different Ninth Circuit panel in 2015 allowed Sunnyvale to enforce a ban on possessing the magazines within city limits . But the court said Friday that the justifications for restrictions in a small , affluent community with a crime rate less than half of California 's average could not be applied statewide . `` Those who live in rural areas where the local sheriff may be miles away , law-abiding citizens trapped in high-crime areas , communities that distrust or depend less on law enforcement , and many more who rely on their firearms to protect themselves and their families '' can have a legitimate need for high-capacity magazines to defend themselves , Judge Kenneth Lee said in the majority opinion .  A study from 1990 to 2015 , relying on government data , found that among 230 million firearms in the United States , <extra_id_99> 115 million had magazines holding more than 10 cartridges , Lee said -- in other words , `` half of all magazines in America are now unlawful to own in California . '' Those numbers also show , he said , that the Supreme Court 's 2008 decision allowing a state to ban `` dangerous and unusual '' weapons did not apply to high-capacity magazines . Lee said private ownership of guns , including high-capacity guns , was crucial in the Revolutionary War and has been throughout U.S. history for the self-defense of racial and sexual minorities , and women .

The heat and winds have been leading to extreme wildfire behavior that makes controlling the fires nearly impossible . On Saturday , fire tornadoes were observed with the Loyalton Fire in Lassen County , Calif. , between Reno , Nev. , and Lake Tahoe . The LNU Lightning Complex fire progressed about three miles to the southeast in just an hour and a half early Wednesday , forcing firefighters and first responders to scramble .  As the fire advanced , a PG&E weather station recorded a temperature spike to <extra_id_99> 114 degrees , indicative of heat coming from the blaze . Many of these fires were sparked by lightning strikes after an unusual line of storms swept into the Bay Area and moved inland Sunday , while other storms featuring dry lightning , which occurs when thunderstorms produce little to no rainfall , sparked still more fires . The scope of the fires facing California is unusually broad , with blazes burning in Monterey County , near the Oroville Dam north of Sacramento , near the Nevada state line as well as the northern coastal areas and southern parts of the state . Other fire complexes , consisting of multiple individual blazes , were burning elsewhere in the state Wednesday morning .  title: Lightning-induced wildfires rage across California amid extreme heat, dryness	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

Wildfires burning from Wine Country to the Peninsula are forcing thousands to evacuate and threatening as many homes . There are so many blazes that Cal Fire combined them into three major groupings , the CZU August Lightning Complex ( San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties ) , the SCU Lightning Complex ( Contra Costa , Alameda and Santa Clara counties ) and the LNU Lightning Complex ( Napa , Sonoma and Solano counties ) , which are so named because they started following abnormal lightning strikes and historic summer heat over the weekend .  By Sunday afternoon , this news organization mapped at least <extra_id_99> 14 lightning-sparked fires across the Bay Area . Smoke from a series of fires hung over the region early Wednesday , bringing a smoky smell and hazy skies and leading the Bay Area Air Quality Management District to issue a Spare the Air alert through Thursday . As of Wednesday morning the fires that have burned 32,095 acres in Napa were zero percent contained , while the lightning-sparked blazes of the Santa Clara area complex in the South Bay and East Bay were about 4 percent contained . More than 500 firefighters continued battling the Marsh and Deer Zone fires , the largest of 20 burning in the immediate Bay Area .  title: Photos: Bay Area’s lightning-sparked wildfires force evacuations, threaten homes	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

: Overnight Evacuations In Vacaville As Lightning-Sparked Fires Spread Across Bay Area Californians have been asked to conserve energy once again as a heat wave continues to pummel the West Coast . CA ISO , which manages the state 's power grid , has issued a Flex Alert for 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday , starting one hour earlier than previous alerts .  The agency said conservation efforts this week have allowed the state to largely avoid massive rolling blackouts , which at one point threatened to leave <extra_id_99> 3.3 million homes in the dark . `` With temperatures forecast above-normal again today , operators are expecting demand on the system to come in high , particularly in the mid-afternoon hours , '' said CA ISO in a statement . With many people now working and attending school from home , conserving energy is a taller order than usual , especially as wildfires burning in the Bay Area and much of the state have sent smoke and unhealthy air over the region forcing many to shut their windows and doors , which helps keep out smoke but can also trap heat inside . But CA ISO said even small changes , when made statewide , can have a significant impact .  title: No Rolling Outages Expected Wednesday In CA, Flex Alert Remains In Place	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>

In the other , firefighters extinguish all wildfires when weather conditions allow , mimicking actual fire management today .  Surprisingly , iLand found little difference between the <extra_id_99> two scenarios . It projected a 1,700 % increase in area burned between 2018 and 2098 , compared with the period 1989 to 2017 , regardless of management scenario .

Illustrating the hazards posed by California 's latest bout of desert-born winds , a blaze dubbed the Silverado fire erupted early Monday and spread across <extra_id_99> 7,200 acres -LRB- 2,913 hectares -RRB- of Orange County by late afternoon , county fire authority spokesman Thanh Nguyen told Reuters . Utility company Southern California Edison said its equipment is under investigation as a possible source of the blaze . Some 90,800 residents were ordered evacuated from homes in and around the city of Irvine as the fire raged largely unchecked through drought-parched brush in the canyons and foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains south of Los Angeles , officials said . No property losses were immediately reported .  title: Wind-whipped Southern California wildfires prompt mass evacuations, injure two firefighters	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
A second Orange County blaze , the Blueridge fire , later broke out near Yorba Linda and has charred roughly 1,200 acres ( 485 hectares ) , Nguyen said . Local television news footage showed at least one home gutted by flames . An estimated 1,170 homes were under evacuation orders from that blaze , the county fire authority said on Twitter late on Monday .  PRECAUTIONARY OUTAGES Southern California Edison reported shutting off electricity to <extra_id_99> 21,000 homes and businesses as a precautionary measure in the face of elevated fire risks posed by dangerous winds . Hundreds of miles away , the Pacific Gas and Electric Company ( PG&E ) said it had cut off power to more than 350,000 of its customers for the same reason . Wind-damaged electrical lines have been implicated in causing dozens of devastating California wildfires in recent years , and utilities have increasingly resorted to such `` public safety power shutoffs '' to reduce the risk . Wind gusts were clocked at up to 89 mph in Sonoma County wine country north of San Francisco Bay , and were steadily blowing at more than 50 mph elsewhere through the region .  title: Wind-whipped Southern California wildfires prompt mass evacuations, injure two firefighters	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
 LOS ANGELES -LRB- AP -RRB- â $ '' Fast-moving wildfires forced evacuation orders for more than 100,000 people and seriously injured two firefighters in Southern California on Monday as powerful winds across the state prompted power to be cut to <extra_id_99> hundreds of thousands to prevent utility equipment from sparking new blazes . A smoky fire exploded in size to over 11 square miles ( 29 square kilometers ) after breaking out around dawn in Orange County , south of Los Angeles . Gusts pushed flames along brushy ridges in Silverado Canyon and near houses in the sprawling city of Irvine , home to about 280,000 residents . There was no containment .  title: 100,000 in Southern California to evacuate as blaze grows	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
PG&E said it had restored power to nearly 100,000 customers as winds eased in some areas , with electricity to be back on at the other homes and buildings by Tuesday night after crews make air and ground inspections to make repairs and ensure it 's safe . A dozen reports of damage had been received , PG&E said . However , the fire threat was far from over in many parts of PG&E 's vast service area .  â $ œWe 're already starting to see winds pick back up , '' hitting 50 mph -LRB- <extra_id_99> 80.4 kph -RRB- in some regions with bone-dry humidity leading to extreme fire danger Monday evening , said Scott Strenfel , PG&E 's head of meteorology . The winds were expected to calm Monday night before renewing again Tuesday , the National Weather Service warned . Officials extended a red flag extreme fire danger warning through 5 p.m. Tuesday for the regionâ $ ™ s eastern and northern mountainous areas . The safety shut-offs â $ œprobably did prevent dangerous fires last night .  title: 100,000 in Southern California to evacuate as blaze grows	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

And the trend is continuing , driven by high housing costs in cities and a desire to return to nature . Meanwhile , built-up greenhouse gases , resulting from human consumption of fossil fuels , have led to increasingly hot , parched conditions in the western United States , with powerful Santa Ana and Diablo winds that fan flames and/or carry embers , sometimes more than a mile , to ignite fires . Intensifying the hazards , overgrown forests have left abundant tinder-dry underbrush and dead trees -- some due to bark beetle infestations , but many the casualties of drought -- primed for disastrous combustion .  A bed-and-breakfast in St. Helena was <extra_id_99> one of hundreds of structures in the Northern California counties of Napa and Sonoma destroyed by this season 's Glass Fire .

It also attempts to carve out safe access for firefighters and equipment . California law requires defensible space for most fire-prone areas , with longtime guidelines imposing the most stringent restrictions on Zone 1 , the first 30 feet surrounding any structure , and slightly less severe requirements on Zone 2 , the band 30 to 100 feet out -- but a bill , recently signed into law , adds Zone 0 , the first 5 feet , a crucial area for ember-to-house ignition . While the specifics are still in progress , Zone 0 will probably have a prohibition against such combustibles as trees , overarching branches , planting beds , wood mulch , log piles , and flammable fences or trellises .  Regulations for the <extra_id_99> two outer zones include minimum tree spacing -LRB- to avoid a continuous canopy -RRB- and removal of lower branches -LRB- to mitigate ladder fuels -RRB- . Planning is also important . Greater distances between structures can reduce house-to-house conflagration , and siting below a hill 's crest , instead of at its peak , can be consequential , as fire tends to race to the top of steep slopes . But for individual buildings , the existing codes `` need to go further , '' says Valachovic .  title: Continuing Education: Wildfire-Adapted Design	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

WASHINGTON -- Battling wildfires while battling the COVID-19 pandemic `` definitely added a new challenge '' for Arizona fire officials this year , but it 's a challenge many say they have met . Exact numbers are hard to come by , but calls to fire departments around the state found most officials reporting only a handful of positive test results on their crews -- and they believe many of those came from exposure off the job .  `` We 've had <extra_id_99> one or two people off a hotshot -LRB- wildfire -RRB- crew test positive but the rest of the crew tested negative , '' said Todd Abel , wildland and battalion chief for Central Arizona Fire and Medical Authority . `` That 's just my personal experience , there have n't been a lot of positive cases during an assignment and just a few of them post-assignment . '' Jayson Coil , assistant chief of operations at the Sedona Fire District , said Arizona firefighters have been `` doing an excellent job '' juggling COVID-19 protocols and firefighting duties . `` We 're asking people to change health behaviors in a difficult environment and we need to be considerate of those environmental factors , '' Coil said .  title: Fire officials claim success in fighting COVID-19 while fighting fires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

More than half -- 56 % -- said they were concerned about the release of prisoners as a result of coronavirus outbreaks behind bars . In addition , 49 % said they were worried about the government `` going too far '' and 38 % feared a `` government collapse .

Gun sales routinely rise after mass shootings , and after elections in which gun-rights candidates have been beaten by politicians who favor tighter strictures on guns . The effect of those additional purchases is more hotly debated . Multiple studies have linked the density of gun-owning households in counties , states and countries to the incidence of gun-related injuries and death .  People with ready access to a firearm are almost twice as likely to be killed and <extra_id_99> three times more likely to commit suicide than those without such access , according to a 2014 study in Annals of Internal Medicine . The researchers who tallied the post - Sandy Hook sales surge also found that accidental firearm deaths to children spiked in tandem with that sales hike . The increases in those child deaths occurred in places where gun sales increased the most . Such findings fall short of establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between gun ownership and injury risk .  title: About 110,000 Californians have bought a gun since the coronavirus arrived, study says	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

`` I am optimistic that the plans in place from the Forest Service will minimize risk to the ski area , but we began taking extra precautions of our own as soon as we became aware of the fire , '' Faber says . `` This past week we put all of our snow guns around the ski area to protect buildings , lifts , and other critical infrastructure .

) Experts say climate change , the management of public lands and decisions over where to site housing all contribute to wildfires . Trump has exclusively blamed poor forest management and last year issued an executive order directing agencies to cut down more trees , arguing that expanding timber harvesting would reduce forest fires .

The wildfires that have raged across the American West these past few weeks -- their horrific images dominating the nightly news and the front pages of the New York Times , the Washington Post and even the Wall Street Journal -- might have finally made climate change a crucial campaign issue in the 2020 presidential election . The pandemic and the economy remain the most pressing concerns for most voters , of course , but the increasing long-term threat to the planet posed by climate change seems to be emerging as an equally concerning issue for many voters . That seems especially true of younger ones , many of whom have long felt that the major parties have not addressed climate change as aggressively as they should have during the past decade .  And as with the pandemic and the economy , the <extra_id_99> two presidential candidates ' differences on climate change could not be starker . In a speech on Monday devoted to the subject of climate change , Joe Biden , the Democratic challenger , called the current president a `` climate arsonist '' and said that Donald Trump 's unwillingness to recognize the threat posed by climate change was putting increasing numbers of Americans at risk . `` Donald Trump 's climate denial may not have caused these fires and record floods and record hurricanes , '' said Biden . `` But if he gets a second term , these hellish events will continue to become more common , more devastating , and more deadly .

I understand the urgency , and together we can get this done . '' This came a day after he had announced a $ 2 trillion plan to combat climate change and environmental racism , which the Washington Post described as `` the most ambitious blueprint released by a major party nominee for president . '' Meanwhile , also on Monday , Trump was in California , meeting with local officials as the West Coast fires raged .  But the meeting clearly did not bring the <extra_id_99> two sides any closer together . During the president 's briefing , which included California Democratic governor Gavin Newsom , those officials repeatedly invoked climate change and its impact on the state 's ability to manage the devastating infernos . `` We 've had temperatures explode this summer , '' said Wade Crowfoot , California 's secretary for natural resources . `` We want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forests and actually work together with that science .  title: Will the Devastating Wildfires and Record-Setting Hurricanes Finally Make Climate Change a Campaign Issue?	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
`` You just -- you just watch . '' `` I wish science agreed with you , '' Crowfoot responded . `` Well , I do n't think science knows , actually , '' Trump said , breaking into another smile .

We recently reported on the unsure fate of five rare California condor chicks caught in the Dolan Fire that has scorched over 100,000 acres on the Big Sur coast . One of the nest cams used by the Ventana Wildlife Society to track the species , recently reintroduced into the wild , showed the fire approaching a chick , as the ominous crackle of burning redwoods could be heard . That condor chick , Iniko , and another missing condor have been found alive and well according to the society 's executive director , Kelly Sorenson .  `` Iniko survived the fire along with <extra_id_99> one other chick plus one other saved before the fire burned through . There were five chicks affected by the Dolan Fire , '' Sorenson told SFGATE . `` Unfortunately , two chicks in other nests did not make it , and the nine condors listed on our website went missing since the fire on August 21 . We are concerned that they may have perished in the fire since it burned through at night and condors do n't typically fly in the dark .

The wildfires have scorched over 6 million acres total , a little over the size of New Hampshire , since Jan. 1 , 2020 , to date , according to the National Interagency Fire Center ( NIFC ) . A total of 87 large fires , not including individual fires within complexes , are burning across the 10 states , according to the agency . The USDA Forest Service defines a `` large fire '' as a fire burning more than a specified area of land , which may differ between states , but also as `` a fire burning with a size and intensity that its behavior is determined by interaction between its own convection column and weather conditions above the surface . ''  For comparison of the intensity of wildfires from 2020 compared to the previous year , California has seen at least 3.3 million acres scorched to date this year where it only saw <extra_id_99> 0.3 million burned throughout the course of 2019 . For the 10 states currently fighting wildfires , only 1.6 million acres had been burned during 2019 . From Jan. 1 , 2020 , to date , the same states have seen a collective 6.5 million acres burned , according to data from the NIFC and compiled state-level fire reporting sources . The smoke from these destructive fires has drifted as far east as parts of Pennsylvania and even dipped down toward more Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee -- and even extending out to sea over Paulette .  title: Satellite image shows wildfire smoke reaching the eastern US as hurricanes churn	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

That 's the situation that four hikers - Asha Karim , Jaymie Shearer , Lucas Wojciechowski and Stephen McKinley - found themselves in earlier this month - ambushed by California 's quick-moving Creek Fire and forced to outmanoeuvre the blaze , which was swallowing tens of thousands of acres . ` What are the chances there 's already a new fire ?

Remnants of Hurricane Sally may sweep some moisture into our region ahead of a cold front Thursday and Friday , but it appears the heaviest rain will stay to our south , as the front and the high pressure pushing that front -- the leading edge of the first major cool shot of the season -- suppress Sally 's movement deep to the south and shove it to the east . This could be very bad news for much of the South , as far north as North Carolina , where flooding rains are likely to develop as Sally only slowly makes a right turn . Amounts are likely to be less than 2 inches in most of our region and quite possibly less than 1 for the immediate Roanoke area , though of course subject to change if the system nudges more north .

As is so often the case in weather , the atmospheric factors leading to the West Coast 's catastrophe will be contributing to another region 's wonderful weather . The dominant upper-air pattern features high pressure aloft over the West , continuing unseasonably hot and dry weather near the West Coast , while the jet stream threads up and over the high with a deep dive to the south across the East .

Customers in parts of 19 counties and in two tribal communities were notified Monday of a potential public safety power shutoff starting as early as Wednesday evening , Pacific Gas & Electric said . A similar power shutoff was implemented last week . No major new fires were reported .  The utility has better targeted outages to limit impact after it was criticized in 2019 for cutting power to about <extra_id_99> 800,000 customers -- about 2 million people -- for days . Meanwhile a court-appointed investigator found PG&E is falling behind in efforts to trim trees to keep limbs from crashing into power lines and igniting fires . The investigator , Mark Filip , said the utility 's `` enhanced vegetation management '' program appeared to backslide this year after making strides in late 2019 , the Sacramento Bee reported . Filip also said PG&E 's equipment inspection program appears to be flawed and badly prioritized .  title: More fire-prevention power shutoffs possible in California	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

The company 's board of directors was cashiered and replaced . But some top executives escaped with gold parachutes worth millions of dollars to go along with their guilty consciences .

Said one division lawyer , `` When a utility fails to provide hospitals , fire departments and people with medical conditions with adequate warning of its decision to execute a shutoff , it is endangering lives .

 SAN DIEGO -LRB- KGTV -RRB- - Firefighting cameras are blanketing California , shattering it 's goal of installing <extra_id_99> 650 cameras across California by 2022 , thanks to the efforts of a UC San Diego professor and his team . The camera system , called ALERTWildfire , came from a need to confirm ignition of a fire , and coordinate assets to be the most efficient and safe for the community . Recent Stories from 10news . com Skip Ad Geology Professor Neal Driscoll at UC San Diego is the Co-Director of ALERTWildfire and said just a couple years ago it was a slow process confirming a fire sparked in the county .  title: UC San Diego firefighting camera system hits new milestone	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>
That wasted valuable time . ALERTWildfire allows fire command centers to find and asses a blaze with a few clicks on a computer . Cal Fire Captain Thomas Shoots said they look for key information from the cameras , `` really just trying to hone in on where this fire is , what it 's potential is and who might need to be evacuated . ''  The system launched in 2017 and now San Diego has <extra_id_99> 35 cameras across the county . The cameras pan , tilt and zoom on command and have a time lapse function . `` The technology is n't just good situational awareness , it 's also using that data and that information in real time to evacuate people and save some more lives , '' Shoots said . Driscoll said they are continuing to grow the program , `` locally I think we 'll cap out at 45-50 .

It was only after the ambulance driver intervened , took her vitals , and insisted that she was legitimately sick that she had the privilege of being brought to the hospital This is another common experience among people -- including myself -- who have sought medical help after living with long-term Covid for months : being told that all of our physical , mental , and neurological symptoms are simply manifestations of our anxiety or depression .  title: Life as a Covid-19 Long-Termer	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

The statewide policy would be backed by reinsurance from the global market and , by covering the first layer of fire losses , would make private insurers more willing to offer additional layers . The national flood insurance program more or less takes that approach . Homeowners in designated flood-prone areas must buy it , but it has limits , so they can purchase supplemental insurance to fill the gap between coverage and loss .  The insurance industry itself took a stab at a solution this year with legislation , Assembly Bill 2167 , allowing insurers to include the cost of reinsurance in their rates , as well as allowing them to base premiums on calculations of future losses -- <extra_id_99> two aspects banned by current law . The shorthand for what insurers proposed is a `` market assistance plan '' that would make insuring homes in fire-prone areas less risky . However , AB 2167 drew fierce opposition from consumer groups , saying it undermined Proposition 103 , the 1988 law that imposed direct regulation on premiums by an elected insurance commissioner . And the current commissioner , Ricardo Lara , joined the opposition .  title: Legislature Ignores Fire Insurance Crisis	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Meanwhile , dozens of wildfires are burning on both sides of the Cascades mountain range in Washington , burning at least five towns , reported Seattle Times . Firefighters stretched thin as fires spread to neighboring states More than 3.1 million acres have burned in California so far during this year 's fire season , according to officials from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Agency ( CAL FIRE ) . In fact , six of the state 's 20 largest fires recorded to date have occurred in 2020 , added CAL FIRE .  The fires have also burned more than 3,900 structures , and at least <extra_id_99> 14,000 firefighters are still out battling major fires . But despite these record-breaking figures , CAL FIRE spokesman Daniel Berlant said Thursday that this number could continue to increase as this year 's fire season is far from over .

But despite state efforts to curb the spread of the fires , firefighters have been hard-pressed to contain major blazes due to unstable weather conditions , leading to the eventual spread of the fires to neighboring states .  title: Devastating Wildfires Continue To Blaze Across California, Oregon And Washington	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>
1 of 3 BOISE , Idaho -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often crews are forced to use them during wildfires . `` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday . `` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate . ''  Still , the shelters have saved more than <extra_id_99> 300 firefighters since they began being used in the 1960s and became required in firefighting equipment in the late 1970s , Bilbao said . They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees of heat for about a minute . The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure . The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said .  title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives but raise questions	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

The North Complex is just one of several massive wildfires that have devastated the region in recent weeks . The death toll from the fires will likely continue to climb as authorities eventually get into areas now blocked by heat and flames . Meanwhile , Southern California - where residents are also struggling with poor air quality - is forecast to get some onshore winds starting Sunday , said Kathy Hoxsie , meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard .

2 . The `` forever chemicals '' in California 's water Even as California tries to crack down on the cancer-causing `` forever chemicals '' contaminating drinking water across the state , the scope of the problem -- and thus of the necessary response -- remains unknown . Less than 9 % of California 's roughly 14,350 public drinking water wells have been tested for PFOA and PFOS , dangerous industrial chemicals used to make firefighting foam , Teflon and food packaging .  Of the tested wells , around 15 % exceeded California 's new , stricter PFOA and PFOS thresholds in at least <extra_id_99> one round of testing over the past year , CalMatters ' Rachel Becker reports . But the tougher restrictions only apply to some of California 's public wells considered especially vulnerable to contamination -- and none of its hundreds of thousands of private wells -- leaving millions of residents in the dark about the safety of their drinking water . To make matters worse , it 's extremely expensive to clean up the chemicals . The Orange County Water District estimates it could cost more than $ 1 billion over the next 30 years to treat contaminated water in wells in its territory .  title: California’s $26B surplus raises tough choices	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

A combination of fast charging and multi-day storage can minimize Flex Alerts during summer and address renewable over-generation in the spring ( CAISO curtailed more than 100 GWh of solar PV this spring ) . Hybridizing the gas turbine fleet Ratepayers , IPPs , and utilities can all benefit by hybridizing the existing gas turbine fleet by adding thermal energy storage at a marginal capital cost of less than $ 25/kWh -- a fraction of the projected future marginal cost of battery packs . A pair of 120-foot diameter molten salt storage tanks , such as those at the Solana solar thermal plant in Arizona , can hold 1.8 GWhe of energy when integrated with Pintail Power 's Liquid Salt Combined Cycle ( LSCC ) technology .  The LSCC approach can increase a gas plant 's power output <extra_id_99> 80 % to 90 % to meet the urgent need for new capacity without consuming more fuel . And if extreme weather or fires go on for extended periods , LSCC units can even recharge themselves using a combination of electricity and exhaust heat . Fast charging using low-cost electric heating of long-duration thermal storage integrated with thermal generation improves the reliability of the grid and the flexibility of power plants during both periods of high demand and of excess solar generation . The result is that both conventional and renewable assets operate more effectively and economically .  title: Adding long-duration storage to the gas fleet lets the grid absorb more solar and avoid brownouts	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
HELENA , Mont.  -- Jon Paul was leery entering his first wildfire camp of the year late last month to fight <extra_id_99> three lightning-caused fires scorching parts of a Northern California forest that had n't burned in 40 years . The 54-year-old engine captain from southern Oregon knew from experience that these crowded , grimy camps can be breeding grounds for norovirus and a respiratory illness that firefighters call the `` camp crud '' in a normal year . He wondered what the coronavirus would do in the tent cities where hundreds of men and women eat , sleep , wash and spend their downtime between shifts . Paul thought about his immunocompromised wife and his 84-year-old mother back home .  title: COVID Plans Put to Test as Firefighters Crowd Camps for Peak Wildfire Season	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>
`` We 're still first responders and we have that responsibility to go and deal with these emergencies , '' he said in a recent interview . `` I do n't scare easy , but I 'm very wary and concerned about my surroundings . I 'm still going to work and do my job . ''  Paul is one of <extra_id_99> thousands of firefighters from across the U.S. battling dozens of wildfires burning throughout the West . It 's an inherently dangerous job that now carries the additional risk of COVID-19 transmission . Any outbreak that ripples through a camp could easily sideline crews and spread the virus across multiple fires -- and back to communities across the country -- as personnel transfer in and out of `` hot zones '' and return home . Though most firefighters are young and fit , some will inevitably fall ill in these remote makeshift communities of shared showers and portable toilets , where medical care can be limited .  title: COVID Plans Put to Test as Firefighters Crowd Camps for Peak Wildfire Season	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>

`` We 're not the experts in a pandemic . We 're the experts with fire .

Paul , the Oregon firefighter , said that the guidelines were followed closely in camp , but less so out on the fire line . It also appeared to him that younger firefighters were less likely to follow the masking and social-distancing rules than the veterans like him .

Faced with those conditions , Pacific Gas and Electric Co. announced Thursday evening that about 21,000 of its customers across parts of Butte , Plumas and Yuba counties might lose electricity this weekend in a potential public safety power shutoff that could begin as early as Saturday evening . PG&E earlier this month cut power to about 172,000 customers in advance of the extreme wind conditions that flared up the southwest corner of the North Complex -- a wildfire that exploded in Butte , Plumas and Yuba counties as the wind drove the fire to jump the middle fork of the Feather River , ravaging communities north and east of Lake Oroville and killing at least 15 people , according to Cal Fire and Butte County officials . PG&E also said Thursday that the utility found over 80 instances of damage or hazards to its power lines the utility had de-energized during that intentional shutoff , which lasted Sept. 7 to Sept. 10 .  Two massive fire complexes are burning in areas included in the fire weather watch : the August Complex , which has already scorched a record-smashing 863,000 acres in and near Mendocino National Forest in portions of Tehama , Humboldt , Trinity , Glenn and Lake counties ; and the North Complex , which , at more than <extra_id_99> 304,000 acres , is the fifth-largest wildfire in California 's recorded history . The SCU Lightning Complex in the South Bay and LNU Lightning Complex in the North Bay , which have each burned between 350,000 and 400,000 acres to become the No. 3 and No. 4 biggest fires recorded in state history , are both within the zone for the Bay Area red flag warning .  title: High wildfire risk, PG&E power shutoff possible as Northern California winds kick up [The Sacramento Bee]	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Fire-weary California prepared Saturday for a new siege of hot , dry weather with potentially strong winds that could cause power lines to arc and spark new blazes in parched vegetation that 's ready to burn .  Pacific Gas & Electric alerted <extra_id_99> 97,000 customers in 15 counties , mostly in Northern California , that their electricity could be cut early Sunday morning in a proactive move to reduce the risk of wildfires . Red Flag warnings for extreme fire weather conditions were to go into effect in northern and central areas of the state at 9 p.m. Saturday and last into Monday , the National Weather Service said . A second burst of winds was expected in those regions late Sunday into Monday , while in Southern California the most critical wind conditions were expected Monday although it was unclear how strong they would be . More than 8,000 California wildfires so far this year have scorched 5,600 square miles ( 14,504 square kilometers ) , destroyed more than 7,000 buildings and killed 26 people .  title: California girds for heat, wind and risk of new wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
The so-called Public Safety Power Shutoff programs used by PG&E and other utilities have been developed in response to disasters . Wildfires sparked by PG&E equipment include the wind-driven 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed much of the Sierra Nevada foothills town of Paradise and killed 85 people . PG&E has said it is refining the process to narrow the scope and shorten the length of power cuts after being sharply criticized for intentional outages last year that affected millions of people and sometimes lasted for days .  When high winds were predicted earlier this month , the utility was able to implement a shutdown that affected just <extra_id_99> 167,000 customers . The utility also began airing 30-minute radio and TV programs during the weekend to familiarize customers with its wildfire safety process . Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger U.S. wildfires to global warming from the burning of coal , oil and gas , especially because climate change has made California much drier . A drier California means plants are more flammable .  title: California girds for heat, wind and risk of new wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger expired and easing winds allowed PG&E to begin restoring power after the largest of five safety shutoffs this year . At its peak , PG&E cut power to about 345,000 customers -- nearly 1 million people -- in 34 counties .  The nation 's largest utility said it restored power to more than <extra_id_99> 300,000 customers , and expected to nearly complete the work by late Tuesday night , with a small number having to wait until Wednesday after crews do inspections to make repairs and ensure equipment is safe . PG&E said it received more than 130 reports of damage or hazards to its equipment . Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable . October and November are traditionally the worst months for fires , but already this year 8,600 wildfires in the state have scorched a record 6,400 square miles ( 16,600 square kilometers ) and destroyed about 9,200 homes , businesses and other buildings .  title: Utility: Winds too weak to cut power before California fire	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

As of Tuesday night , only about 2,000 of Edison 's 5 million customers were without power , according to an outage website . A study by the Manhattan Institute last year found that PG&E was far more likely to institute emergency shutoffs -- and cut off power to far more people -- than Edison in Southern California .  title: Utility: Winds too weak to cut power before California fire	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
By contrast , in the past few years California intentionally burned roughly 50 thousand acres on public lands . In fact , a study published in the journal Fire showed that prescribed burns on federal lands in the West over the past 20 years stayed flat or fell despite ongoing calls to do much more . ` Losing this battle every year ' Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) was the only federal agency to substantially increase prescribed fire use , the study said , likely due to tribal self-governance and a historic embrace of intentional fire .  Federal and California officials recently signed an agreement to try boost that significantly : the new goal is to treat about <extra_id_99> 1 million acres a year with combined thinning and controlled burns . But experts warn that states continue to set ambitions prescribed fire goals they never reach . And critics say that new goal is nowhere near enough to meet this moment . `` It 's not something in which incremental , cautious decisions are going to solve the problem , '' says Malcolm North , an outspoken research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who has long advocated for more controlled burns .  title: Experts To Western States: Time To Finally Fight Wildfires With More Fire	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. avoided major wildfires during its outage , while Southern California Edison is trying to determine if one of its power lines started a massive fire that drove nearly 100,000 people from their homes in Orange County during fierce winds and extremely dry conditions early Monday . `` I do n't know why they did not shut power off , '' said attorney Gerald Singleton , who has sued utilities for devastating wildfires caused by their equipment . `` They seem to be still be operating as if climate change and all these things we 're dealing with are not a reality . ''  The utility defended its decision not to institute a type of blackout used increasingly as a means of protecting residents after several devastating wildfires , including a 2018 inferno sparked by PG&E equipment that nearly razed the community of Paradise , killed 85 people and destroyed <extra_id_99> 19,000 homes and other buildings . Edison spokesman Chris Abel said wind speeds in the mountains above the city of Irvine at the time had not reached the threshold to pull the plug on the power , though they did later in the morning when some electric circuits were cut . `` It 's not something that we take lightly , '' Abel said of the decision to shut off electricity . `` We know that not having power is a tremendous burden on our customers .

LOS ANGELES -- ( AP ) -- Crews tried to beat back two out-of-control wildfires in Southern California on Tuesday that have kept tens of thousands of people out of their homes even as another round of dangerous fire weather raises the risk for flames erupting across the state . Fierce winds that drove twin fires through brushy hills near cities in Orange County a day earlier were expected to pick back up , although not to the earlier extremes , according to the National Weather Service . Southern California Edison reported to regulators that it was investigating whether its equipment might have sparked the Silverado Fire near the city of Irvine .  The utility said a wire that lashed a telecommunications line to a supporting cable may have struck a <extra_id_99> 12,000-volt conducting line above it . Edison was among the utilities in California that deliberately cut power to customers to prevent equipment from being knocked down or hit with debris in the winds and sparking wildfires . Utility equipment has been blamed for several destructive fires in recent years . Irvine residents had to evacuate after the fire broke out early Monday , while later and a few miles away , another blaze , the Blue Ridge Fire , sent people fleeing from the Yorba Linda area .  title: Wind a risk as California fires keep tens of thousands away	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
In Northern California , easing winds allowed Pacific Gas & Electric to begin restoring power after the largest of five safety shutoffs this year .

 Geological Society of America Boulder , Colo. , USA : Across the western U.S. , severe wildfires fueled by tinder-dry vegetation have already burned more than <extra_id_99> 3.2 million hectares -LRB- 8 million acres -LSB- as of the time of this press release -RSB- -RRB- -- an area the size of Maryland -- in 2020 , and nearly six times that area burned this year in Australia . And even though neither country 's worst-ever fire year is not yet over , concerns are already mounting regarding the next hazard these regions will face : dangerous and destructive debris flows . Debris flows are fast-moving slurries of soil , rock , water , and vegetation that are especially perilous because they usually occur without any warning .

And even though neither country 's worst-ever fire year is not yet over , concerns are already mounting regarding the next hazard these regions will face : dangerous and destructive debris flows . Debris flows are fast-moving slurries of soil , rock , water , and vegetation that are especially perilous because they usually occur without any warning . Some debris flows are powerful enough to cart off everything in their paths , including trees , boulders , vehicles -- and even homes .  Two years ago in Montecito , California , <extra_id_99> 23 people were killed and more than 400 homes damaged by a series of debris flows spawned by intense rain falling on hills scorched by what at the time had been the largest fire in California history . To better understand the origin of these hazards , researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) studied slope failure at two sites in Southern California 's San Gabriel Mountains . The first site burned in 2016 during the San Gabriel Complex fire , whereas a second , nearby site was charred during the 2014 Colby fire . The findings , presented Wednesday during the annual meeting of The Geological Society of America , indicate there were major differences in slope failure between the first and the third years following incineration .  title: Post-wildfire hazards: Toward an understanding of when & how slope failure may occur	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

2020 was n't normal , but what is normal ? If 2020 has proved anything , it is to expect the unexpected . Before this year , Colorado had not recorded a fire of over 10,000 acres starting in October .  This year , the East Troublesome fire grew from about 20,000 acres to over <extra_id_99> 100,000 acres in less than 24 hours on Oct. 21 , and it was nearly 200,000 acres by the time a snowstorm stopped its advance . Instead of going skiing , hundreds of Coloradans evacuated their homes and nervously watched whether that fire would merge with another giant blaze . This is not `` the new normal '' -- it 's the new abnormal . In a warming climate , looking at what happened in the past no longer offers a sense of what to expect in the future .  title: Here’s How the 2020 Western Wildfire Season Got So Extreme	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
FORT COLLINS , Colo. -- A wildfire that has scorched more than 326 square miles ( 844 square kilometers ) since it started in mid-August , becoming the largest in Colorado history , has damaged or destroyed more than 200 homes , officials said .  As of Monday , the Cameron Peak Fire in northern Colorado had destroyed 426 buildings and damaged another <extra_id_99> eight , said David Moore , a spokesman for the Larimer County Sheriff 's Office . The affected buildings include 209 homes , 208 outbuildings and 17 buildings that were designated as businesses as part of the Shambhala Mountain Center , a meditation retreat in the mountains northwest of Fort Collins . The fire ignited in arid and rugged terrain near Rocky Mountain National Park on Aug. 13 and has charred some of the most pristine land in the state . Fire investigators have not said what caused the blaze , which is 64 % contained .  title: Colorado’s largest wildfire has burned more than 200 homes	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>

The findings , presented Wednesday during the annual meeting of The Geological Society of America , indicate there were major differences in slope failure between the first and the third years following incineration . The results will help inform land managers and residents about when and where debris flows and other types of slope failure are more likely to occur . `` In the first year after each fire , we observed debris flows generated by rainfall runoff , '' says Francis Rengers , a USGS research geologist who led the study .  `` But as we continued monitoring , we were surprised to see that <extra_id_99> a storm with a higher rainfall intensity than the first year 's storms , resulted in more than 280 shallow landslides , rather than debris flows , in the third year . '' In contrast to debris flows , which have fluid-like behavior , landslides glide as cohesive masses along a rupture plane . The researchers , including scientists from the University of Arizona , the Desert Research Institute , the USGS , and the German Research Centre ( GFZ ) believe this difference is due to changes in how much water can infiltrate into the ground during storms that follow wildfires . Because severe wildfires make soils more water-repellent , Rengers says , rainfall tends to run off burned ground .  title: Post-wildfire hazards: Toward an understanding of when & how slope failure may occur	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Damage assessment crews were combing the area after snow and cold weather put a damper on the fire over the weekend . Meanwhile , crews were trying to determine how many homes were damaged and destroyed by Colorado 's second-largest recorded wildfire which forced evacuations and closed Rocky Mountain National Park . The East Troublesome Fire , just southwest of the Cameron Peak Fire , has destroyed about 301 square miles ( 780 square kilometers ) and is 20 % contained .  The blaze forced <extra_id_99> thousands of people to flee their homes and burned part of Rocky Mountain National Park , but the full extent of the damages is not yet known . Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin has previously said there was `` lots of structural loss '' because of the fire but has declined to estimate the number of homes lost . The town of Grand Lake , which was evacuated last week after the fire exploded in size , was not damaged , and no one is unaccounted for in the area burned by the fire . Lyle and Marylin Hileman , aged 86 and 84 , were found dead Friday after refusing to leave their home near Grand Lake .  title: Colorado’s largest wildfire has burned more than 200 homes	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
The nation 's largest utility said it restored power to more than 228,000 customers and planned to complete the work by Tuesday night after crews do inspections to make repairs and ensure equipment is safe . It received dozens of reports of damage to its equipment , PG&E said . Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable .  October and November are traditionally the worst months for fires , but already this year 8,600 wildfires in the state have scorched a record 6,400 square miles -LRB- <extra_id_99> 16,600 square kilometers -RRB- and destroyed about 9,200 homes , businesses and other buildings . There have been 31 deaths . When the Orange County fires broke out Monday morning , Edison had only cut power to 30 customers in the Santa Clarita Valley north of Los Angeles . As of Tuesday afternoon , some 14,500 of Edison 's 5 million customers were without power , Abel said .  title: Utility: Winds too weak to cut power before California fire	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

( AP ) -- Authorities say a wildfire burning in the scenic Columbia River Gorge that has destroyed dozens of structures is 65 % contained . Some evacuation orders have been downgraded as of Monday for the time being due to the containment progress . The fire has burned nearly 1,000 acres and fire officials do n't believe they 'll have the blaze fully contained until the end of the month .  The Oregon Department of Forestry says <extra_id_99> 36 structures have been destroyed and about 660 are still being threatened .  title: Columbia River Gorge fire may burn through the month	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
It would be exorbitantly expensive to build enough power plants to ensure the electricity never goes off -- and some of those plants might sit idle for years at a time . So instead , the U.S. utility industry has long followed a standard of having enough power on call to ensure this type of outage does n't happen more than once every 10 years . The last time California was forced to implement rotating blackouts because of insufficient energy supply was nearly 20 years ago , during the 2001 energy crisis , as opposed to more recent intentional outages because of fire safety .  But these blackouts may strike a raw nerve for many PG&E customers after the utility 's decision last year to shut down power to <extra_id_99> millions of people in an effort to prevent its aging and poorly maintained transmission lines from igniting wildfires . In a letter to his own top energy officials Monday , Gov. Gavin Newsom described the blackouts as `` unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation 's largest and most innovative state . '' He instructed them to investigate what had gone wrong and take several steps to better prepare for future heat waves .  title: California blackouts are Public Utilities Commission's fault, grid operator says	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
Gavin Newsom said . Newsom expressed optimism that most of the smaller blazes would be suppressed relatively quickly . In Nevada County in the Sierra Nevada , a fire erupted Monday in a canyon northwest of Nevada City and quickly spread .  Nearly <extra_id_99> 4,000 people were under evacuation orders , authorities said . Near California 's northern border with Nevada , a 62-square-mile ( 160.58-square-kilometer ) fire ignited by lightning near the community of Loyalton was 10 % contained after destroying five homes and a half-dozen other structures , the Tahoe National Forest said . It was burning through timber , sage and tall grass . Across the state line , school officials in Reno postponed Monday 's scheduled reopening of classrooms .  title: California firefighters battle wildfires in extreme heat	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
There was zero containment . Several lightning-sparked fires prompted evacuation orders and warnings across the San Francisco Bay Area , including a fast-growing blaze to the north in rural Napa County . In the East Bay , crews protected canyon homes from flames churning through dry brush near Milpitas .  In the mountains and desert of northern Los Angeles County , the 6-day-old Lake Fire was <extra_id_99> 38 % contained after scorching 29.7 square miles -LRB- 76.92 square kilometers -RRB- . The blaze , which consumed thousands of acres of brush in its first few hours , had more moderate behavior by Sunday but about 4,500 homes remained at risk , county Supervisor Kathryn said . A dozen structures , including homes , have been destroyed there . Smoke from the Lake Fire and smaller fires in mountains east and west of Los Angeles led regulators to declare unhealthy air quality for a wide area of suburbs .  title: California firefighters battle wildfires in extreme heat	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Homeowners in fire-prone areas of California have had it rough in recent years . Not only have they been threatened by gigantic , climate-change-fueled wildfires , but their insurance premiums have skyrocketed -- if they have n't been dumped by insurers worried about huge claims from the blazes that will inevitably come .  Over the course of four particularly bad fire years , from 2015 to 2018 , more than <extra_id_99> 340,000 homeowners in rural areas were told by insurers their policies would not be renewed , according to the California Department of Insurance . Those unable to find another insurance company willing to write a new policy have been left with the high-cost option of last resort , the California FAIR plan . It 's a bad situation -- and it could get even worse if lawmakers approve Assembly Bill 2167 , a legislative `` fix '' championed by the insurance industry that purports to improve coverage in areas of high fire risk . But the only thing that 's likely to improve under these proposed changes is the bottom line of insurance companies , say California 's Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara and consumer advocates , including the author of Proposition 103 , the landmark consumer protection law regulating property and casualty insurance rates in California .  title: Guest Editorial: An insurance fix that only insurers could love	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
It 's very steep , so I know it 's hard for firefighters to get up there , '' said Dawn Phillips , who works in customer service for the winery . In Southern California , evacuations continued for a week-old fire in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County . Dynamic weather churned up thunderstorms bringing the double threat of more lightning-sparked fires and flash floods .  California ISO issued the first rolling blackouts in nearly 20 years on Friday , resulting in the state 's three biggest utilities -- Pacific Gas & Electric , Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric -- turning off power to more than <extra_id_99> 410,000 homes and businesses for about an hour at a time until the emergency declaration ended 3 1/2 hours later . A second but shorter outage hit Saturday evening , affecting more than 200,000 customers . Former Gov. Jerry Brown called the rolling blackouts `` a kerfuffle , not a crisis , '' adding that California 's bigger challenge will be boosting its renewable energy sources to handle the increased demand for electricity that will come due to climate change .  title: Power operators eye thermostat, Newsom declares emergency	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
However , the relative changes correlated well with both the regulatory and professional monitors . The researchers calculated an adjustment factor of approximately 0.48 when using PurpleAir PA-II monitors outdoors during the Camp , Carr , and Mendocino Complex Fires in California and the Pole Creek Fire in Utah ( meaning the readings should be multiplied by 0.48 to estimate the true PM2 .5 level ) . This correction is very close to one of the data conversion options ( `` LRAPA '' ) given on the PurpleAir website .  Good for other indoor pollutants too In a separate study earlier this year , Delp and Singer , along with first author Zhiqiang Wang , evaluated <extra_id_99> six low-cost air quality monitors by comparing their output to reference PM2 .5 and PM10 measurements from 21 common residential sources , such as frying , grilling , microwaving popcorn , vacuuming , and burning candles . The study , published in the journal Building and Environment , was an update to their 2018 study . They found that for most pollution sources , the low-cost monitors tracked with the professional ones within a factor of two for PM2 .5 . Delp said the consumer monitors `` enable people to identify activities that emit fine particulate matter inside their homes and to determine if operating filters or just keeping windows closed is effectively reducing exposure inside when there is very bad air pollution outside .  title: Low-cost home air quality monitors prove useful for wildfire smoke	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
`` I know it 's hot and I know it 's hard , but those same actions today can make all the difference in the world . '' The state is in a days-long heatwave that has stressed the electrical system and resulted in rolling blackouts over two nights last weekend . The strong ridge of high pressure responsible for the heat wave was expected to weaken , but excessive hot weather was forecast for the weekend as families stay at home because of the coronavirus pandemic .  Newsom declared a statewide emergency Tuesday , saying that <extra_id_99> hundreds of wildfires were burning in the state , with some sparked by lightning . `` We are deploying every resource available to keep communities safe as California battles fires across the state during these extreme conditions , '' he said . Evacuations were in effect or growing in the Napa County wine country north of San Francisco Bay , near Salinas in Monterey County , around Oroville Dam north of Sacramento and near the Nevada state line north of Lake Tahoe . A fire in Napa County was burning close to remote grape-growing properties owned by Villa Del Lago Winery .  title: Power operators eye thermostat, Newsom declares emergency	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

Conspiracy theories about the dangerous wildfires burning in California , Oregon and Washington have thrived on social media . A new rumor on Facebook suggests that environmental factors connected to climate change , like severe heat and drought , have nothing to do with the fires .

Cowen 's online map shows variations of facial expressions associated with 16 emotions . They used the algorithm to track instances of 16 facial expressions one tends to associate with amusement , anger , awe , concentration , confusion , contempt , contentment , desire , disappointment , doubt , elation , interest , pain , sadness , surprise and triumph . Next , they correlated the facial expressions with the contexts and scenarios in which they were made across different world regions and discovered remarkable similarities in how people across geographic and cultural boundaries use facial expressions in different social contexts .  `` We found that rich nuances in facial behavior -- including subtle expressions we associate with awe , pain , triumph , and <extra_id_99> 13 other feelings -- are used in similar social situations around the world , '' Cowen said . For example , Cowen noted , in the video clips , people around the world tended to gaze in awe during fireworks displays , show contentment at weddings , furrow their brows in concentration when performing martial arts , show doubt at protests , pain when lifting weights and triumph at rock concerts and competitive sporting events . The results showed that people from different cultures share about 70 % of the facial expressions used in response to different social and emotional situations . `` This supports Darwin 's theory that expressing emotion in our faces is universal among humans , '' Keltner said .  title: UC Berkeley: The 16 Facial Expressions Most Common To Emotional Situations Worldwide	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
`` In general , the goal is to reduce the severity of a fire when it occurs , which can aid in controlling fires near homes , '' Andrew Plantinga , a professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California , Santa Barbara , who co-authored the study , wrote in an email . These projects are expensive but necessary , especially after decades of mismanagement that have left forests primed to burn . And with more people moving to what 's known as the wildland-urban interface while forests simultaneously heat up and dry out due to the climate crisis , rebalancing forests is becoming even more necessary to keep people safe .  The authors crunched the numbers on where exactly the government -- specifically the Bureau of Land Management , Forest Service , and National Park Service -- focuses projects of this kind , examining over <extra_id_99> 41,000 census blocks that had been within 1.2 miles -LRB- 2 kilometers -RRB- of a wildfire between 2000 and 2011 . They found that all else equal , these agencies were up to 25 % more likely to fund fuel treatment near communities where more than half of of residents are white and live above the poverty line . Neighborhoods with nearly all-white residents had a 30 % higher chance of receiving a fuel treatment nearby , and areas where almost no residents were living in poverty had a 40 % increased likelihood . The findings are particularly troubling in light of a major 2018 study , which found that people of color and low-income people are far more vulnerable to wildfires ' devastation .  title: The Federal Government Spends More on Fire Prevention in Rich, White Neighborhoods	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

It 's not completely clear why the discrepancies uncovered by the new report exist .

Evacuations were ordered for several canyon neighborhoods near the city of Lake Forest and residents of other nearby areas were told to be ready to get out . It was not immediately known how many people were affected or if any homes were damaged . The Bond Fire about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) southeast of Los Angeles is burning near the same area of October 's Silverado Fire , which forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate .  The new blaze broke out as Southern California utilities cut the power to <extra_id_99> tens of thousands of customers to avoid the threat of wildfires during the notorious Santa Anas . Red flag warnings of extreme fire danger through Saturday were in place because of low humidity , bone-dry brush and the winds , which sweep down from the interior , the National Weather Service said . Utilities in the populous region began cutting power Wednesday to customers as a precaution to prevent gusts from blowing tree limbs into electrical equipment or knocking down power lines , which have sparked devastating wildfires in recent years . Southern California Edison cut power to about 15,000 homes and businesses by late Wednesday night and was considering de-energizing lines serving about 271,000 customers in seven counties throughout the windy period , which could last into Saturday .  title: Wind fans wildfire in California canyons, residents flee	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

They reported success keeping the fire mostly north of two northern Colorado state highways .  title: Gusty winds threaten new growth for Rocky Mountain wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
They reported success keeping the fire mostly north of two northern Colorado state highways . A drone flown with an infrared camera at night has helped firefighters put out small fires caused by embers blown across the roads , Peterson said . Firefighters last week took advantage of calmer weather to intentionally burn out timber and brush along the highways , creating wider barriers to the fire than the pavement alone .  The almost <extra_id_99> 240-square-mile fire was 14 % contained , while the nearly 200-square-mile Cameron Peak Fire 20 miles west of Fort Collins was 42 % contained . Wind was putting firefighters more on the defensive against the fire burning through the Cache la Poudre River drainage and other areas north of and partly inside Rocky Mountain National Park , Cameron Peak Fire operations trainee John Norton-Jensen said in a Monday briefing . About 25 miles of mountainous forest with little human development separated the fires . Firefighters did n't expect the fires to connect .  title: Gusty winds threaten new growth for Rocky Mountain wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

At the same time , we know that the most critical part of fire season has just begun . In view of our collective situation , fire preparations all around the state have taken on an extreme urgency . As they plan to recover and prepare , communities and landowners across the state will be able to draw upon expertise and assistance from little-known public agencies that are well positioned to help .  California is home to <extra_id_99> 95 Resource Conservation Districts that serve rural , urban and suburban populations . Their conservation professionals and local experts are committed to helping communities protect themselves against the impacts of climate change , such as the super-charged fires that now strike us with great regularity . For decades , these Resource Conservation Districts have worked in partnership with landowners , local governments , nonprofit agencies and the public to restore habitat , build healthy soils , enhance water quality and otherwise do the work of conserving California 's natural resources . In the aftermath of these fires , they are prepared to step in immediately to help .  title: Ken Hale: Agencies that help us recover from wildfires and prepare our lands	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Pechet says Homebound 's fee for all this is within the industry 's standard range of 15 % to 25 % of the total project cost . Pechet and Abraham 's plan was to start in Santa Rosa , then make their service more widely available to anyone building a custom home , even in areas not recovering from disaster . But just a few months after founding the company , Pechet was opening a new office in Southern California to respond to the Woolsey Fire , which destroyed hundreds of homes in Malibu .

The first fire in Yellowstone that summer began on June 14 with the start of the Storm Creek fire according to the NPS site . That was followed by the Shoshone Fire , Fan Fire , Red Fire and Lava Fire into early July . The National Park Service remembers that it was July 21 , 1988 when they began fighting the fires including the 2nd time ever that US Army active duty troops were deployed on US soil .  August 20 is remembered as Black Saturday when the Yellowstone wildfire size doubled to <extra_id_99> 480,000 acres on the NPS timeline . The most iconic moment I recall from the Yellowstone wildfires of 1988 happened in September when I recall the fires closing in on the Old Faithful part of the park including the Inn . The fact that it was saved and no one was injured is something I still consider a miracle .

There were similar splits on addressing water quality , emissions restrictions on power plants and tougher fuel-efficiency standards . `` To the extent there is a swing vote in this election , it 's a lot of Republican-leaning women , many of whom are in the suburbs , '' said John Podesta , a top adviser to former President Barack Obama on climate change who also served as Hillary Clinton 's campaign chairman . `` And this is an issue they care about .

It 's stressing them out , and we have to keep their heads in the game , '' he said . COVID also has limited the state 's use of inmate fire crews -- either because of early inmate releases to prevent outbreaks in prisons or because many are under quarantine in those prisons , both Berland and Geissler said .

The damaging effects of gender reveals extend beyond the children , sometimes to thousands of acres of forests . In 2017 , off-duty Border Patrol agent Dennis Dickey started a wildfire when he shot a decorative target with an explosive to announce that he was having a son . The fire burned $ 8.2 million in property , though Dickey only had to pay $ 220,000 in fines after pleading guilty .  Still , for a Border Patrol agent making somewhere between $ 55,000 and $ <extra_id_99> 100,000 a year -LRB- according to the agency 's website -RRB- , that 's a lot of cash that Dickey 's son will never see . As for this year 's Southern California gender reveal fire , officially named the El Dorado Fire , the occupation of the couple has not yet been released , nor has the sex of the child . It 's safe to say the family will also be looking at a hefty fine , because the El Dorado Fire has torched 12,000 acres in San Bernardino County and is only 18 % contained as of Thursday afternoon , according to Cal Fire .

By stamping out smaller fires and those that ignite during wetter months , Stahl said officials have allowed fuels to build up , setting the stage for bigger fires during times of drought and hot , windy weather . That 's been exacerbated this year by the coronavirus pandemic , which prompted U.S. Forest Service Chief Vickie Christiansen to issue a directive in June to fight all fires aggressively , reversing a decades-long trend of allowing some to burn . The idea was to minimize large concentrations of firefighters by extinguishing blazes quickly .  Fighting the flames from the air was key to the strategy , with <extra_id_99> 35 air tankers and 200 helicopters being used , Forest Service spokesperson Kaari Carpenter said . Yet by Aug. 30 , following the deaths of some firefighters , including four aviators , and several close calls , fire officials in Boise warned that long-term fatigue was setting in . They called for a `` tactical pause '' so fire commanders could reinforce safe practices . Tim Ingalsbee , a member of the advocacy group Firefighters United for Safety , Ethics and Ecology , said the June directive from Christiansen returned the forest service to a mindset prevalent for much of the last century that focused on putting out fires as quickly as possible .  title: Taxed resources still fight western fires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>
The Bobcat Fire in the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles came within 500 feet of the observatory on Tuesday but a bulldozer line , burnout operations , water drops and brush clearance maintained there created protection , Angeles National Forest officials said in social media posts . `` While there is still much work to be done in southwest and in the northern sections of the fire , your firefighters did incredible work around Mt.

This year will probably be even more costly . But as the toll of wildfire increases , the federal government is supporting less research into the issue . The budget for the Joint Fire Science Program , which is funded through the Interior and Agriculture departments and produces research on the best practices for fire prevention and management , has steadily declined since the mid-2000s .  In a 2017 budget deal approved before the current administration , the program 's funding was reduced from $ <extra_id_99> 12.9 million to $ 8.9 million .

Embers carried far ahead of the main front enable fires to travel dozens of miles in a single day . `` It 's like a blow torch in a wind tunnel , '' said Ingalsbee , whose home in Eugene , Ore. , is mere miles from the perimeter of the 167,000-acre Holiday Farm Fire . `` These fires are beyond human control . ''  Federal spending on wildfire suppression has ballooned from roughly $ <extra_id_99> 450 million per year in the 1990s to a record-setting $ 3.1 billion in 2018 .

In a 2019 executive order , President Trump called on the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to consider harvesting 4.4 . million board feet of timber from public lands as a means to reduce wildfire risk . The majority of forest in the West is controlled by the federal government ; in California , for example , the state manages only 3 % of forested land .  Logging in national forests - which in the 1980s produced as much as <extra_id_99> 12 billion board feet of timber per year - has fallen precipitously and now generates about 3 billion board feet annually . Current management plans for these forests call for logging nearly twice as much . American Forest Resource Council President Travis Joseph , whose Portland , Ore.-based group represents mills , manufacturers and purchasers of timber from public lands across the West , said in a phone interview that climate change has certainly worsened fires , but the forest industry can play a role in fighting them by alleviating the buildup of fuel . `` What we 're pushing for , ultimately , is resiliency , sustainability and protection of our forests , '' Joseph said .  title: Trump's plan for managing forests won't save us in a more flammable world, experts say.	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Even in areas that are untouched by the fires themselves , the rippling effects of these fires can and have been felt far and wide . California 's wildfire season has caused increased pollutants that raise the Air Quality Index in past years , such as the Kincaide fire of 2019 , which caused AQI levels of 150 or more . However , the combination of fires this year , both in state and out of state , have sparked unprecedented highs .  Many areas are averaging an AQI of <extra_id_99> 200 , and several areas , such as Sacramento , are reaching numbers of 400 or higher . According to Airnow , a government partner of the EPA dedicated to monitoring Air Quality , 200 + AQI is classified as `` Very Unhealthy '' and they warn that the chance for adverse health effects from exposure is higher for everyone . Areas that have reached the level of 300 + AQI are labelled as dangerous health conditions , which have far more pronounced effects on the health of all people in that area . Aside from the AQI score , the smoke has been affecting how the sky looks as well .  title: Bad air quality reaches record highs	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
 Crew members of a Southern California dive boat have told investigators they were n't trained on emergency procedures before a fire broke out last year and killed 34 people STEFANIE DAZIO and TOM KRISHER Associated Press September 17 , 2020 , 12:06 AM • 6 min read LOS ANGELES -- Crew members on a dive boat say they were never instructed on emergency procedures before a predawn fire swept through the vessel as it was anchored off the Southern California coast , killing <extra_id_99> 34 people as they slept below deck , according to federal documents released Wednesday . National Transportation Safety Board investigators say the cause of the blaze aboard the Conception remains undetermined but a possible ignition point was phones and other electronics plugged into outlets . One crew member told investigators he saw sparks when he plugged in his cellphone hours before the fire . The boat was carrying 33 passengers on a Labor Day weekend scuba diving expedition last year .  title: No emergency training for crew on boat where fire killed 34	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
Kyle McAvoy , a marine safety specialist with Robson Forensic in Philadelphia who often is an expert witness in trials , said the hatch should have been discussed at safety briefings but that it 's required to be `` fairly clear and obvious '' how to open it . While interviewing Cullen Molitor , the boat 's second captain , investigators asked repeatedly about items plugged into electrical outlets in the Conception 's galley . Molitor said divers plugged in flashlights , camera equipment , strobe lights and cellphones the night of the fire .  He estimated there were <extra_id_99> 10 to 20 items plugged in on one side and five to 15 on the other , with at least one power strip , although he said he did n't know for sure , according to an interview transcript . The Coast Guard has issued additional safety recommendations following the tragedy , such as limiting charging of lithium-ion batteries and the use of power strips and extension cords . Molitor also said there were two smoke detectors in the bunk room and two in the galley , but he did n't hear any alarms after a crew member woke him . He was n't sure if they were wired together to sound at once but said he would expect to hear them from where he was sleeping .  title: No emergency training for crew on boat where fire killed 34	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Investigating bad convictions was one thing .

`` For a minute there , I really thought we would all be infected with COVID-19 and I was wondering who would be responding to the fires , '' he said . It was enough to convince Swaney that this year the tribe would n't share any of its 60 firefighters with neighbors .

As the intensity of fires and temperatures rise due to global warming , the western forests lost in severe blazes may be unable to grow back to what they once were , the research said . `` As more area burns at high severity , the likelihood of conversion to different forest types or even to non-forest increases , '' said Sean Parks , a research ecologist at the Forest Service organization and lead author of the study . `` At the same time , the post-fire climate is making it increasingly difficult for seedlings to establish and survive , further reducing the potential for forests to return to their pre-fire condition , '' he said in a statement .  Overall , wildfires have scorched millions of acres in California and the Pacific Northwest this year , the worst fire season in regional history , and they have killed several <extra_id_99> dozen people . The 2020 months of August , September and October ranked as California 's hottest since records began in 1895 , according to the U.S. National Weather Service . Fires are often a natural component of an ecosystem , but while areas have evolved to handle low-intensity blazes , few can recover from the destruction of severe fires , experts say .

WASHINGTON -- The number of wildfires and the amount of land they consume in the western U.S. has substantially increased since the 1980s , a trend often attributed to ongoing climate change . Now , new research finds fires are not only becoming more common in the western U.S. but the area burned at high severity is also increasing , a trend that may lead to long-term forest loss . The new findings show warmer temperatures and drier conditions are driving an eight-fold increase in annual area burned by high severity fire across western forests from 1985-2017 .  In total , annual area burned by high severity wildfires -- defined as those that kill more than 95 % of trees -- increased by more than <extra_id_99> 450,000 acres . `` As more area burns at high severity , the likelihood of conversion to different forest types or even to non-forest increases , '' said Sean Parks , a research ecologist with the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station and lead author of the new study . `` At the same time , the post-fire climate is making it increasingly difficult for seedlings to establish and survive , further reducing the potential for forests to return to their pre-fire condition .

Prop 20 would establish two new types of crimes : serial crime and organized retail crime , and it would increase penalties for repeat shoplifters .  Changing the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation 's -LRB- CDCR -RRB- parole review program , Prop 20 would reclassify <extra_id_99> 51 crimes and sentence enhancements as violent in order to exclude them from the program , which is only available to nonviolent offenders . It would also require that an incarcerated person 's entire criminal record is taken into account before becoming eligible for parole , instead of only looking at that individual 's most recent offense . It would also allow prosecutors to request a review of the parole review board 's final decision . The initiative makes critical adjustments to 2011 's AB 109 , 2014 's Proposition 47 , and 2016 's Proposition 57 , all of which were California legislative responses to the 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that declared overcrowding in California 's prisons violated the Eight Amendment 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment .  title: On Your Nov.

The investigative results for two fires that broke out northwest of Los Angeles a year ago were released as power cuts were underway in parts of Northern California to prevent electrical equipment from igniting fires amid gusty , dry weather . The 1,800-acre ( 728-hectare ) Easy Fire , which threatened the library and nearby Simi Valley homes , ignited Oct. 30 , 2019 , when an insulator attached to a Southern California Edison power line swung into a steel power pole during windy , dry conditions , the Ventura County Fire Department said in a statement . At the time , the utility reported to state regulators that its equipment may have been involved in the fire , which damaged two buildings .  The Ventura County department also said the Maria Fire near Santa Paula was ignited the next day by failure of a conductor on an electrical distribution line owned by California Resources Corp. `` Fire investigators found that <extra_id_99> an electrical conductor separated and contacted a metal pipe on the ground , igniting the fire , '' the department said . Nearly 15.6 square miles ( 40 square kilometers ) were scorched , and four buildings were damaged . California Resources Corp. , a publicly traded oil and gas exploration and production company , claimed in a statement that Southern California Edison was at fault . The fire started when Southern California Edison `` reenergized its power distribution to our field after a power safety shutdown without giving us prior notice and opportunity to inspect our equipment , '' it said .  title: 2 California wildfires last year blamed on electrical lines	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Residents who barely escaped the latest fast-moving fire say they need a seamless system that crosses county lines and gives clear , useful information about what is happening . They want evacuation maps to accompany written descriptions posted on social media to make it easier to see what areas are in danger , and they want all counties , regardless of size and resources , to give accurate and timely alerts . Some people did not get warnings ; others say they went out too late .  Roughly <extra_id_99> 15,000 firefighters are battling blazes throughout California , the largest ones burning for more than a week in multiple counties around the San Francisco Bay Area .

Two-tenths of an inch in 15 minutes has been identified as a threshold around Glenwood Canyon for setting off slides . That 's less than half an inch per hour and not an unusual rainstorm even in semi-arid Colorado , yet it could set off what the hydrologists described as significant debris flows that typically gain momentum leading to larger rock-ripping torrents downstream . The scientists said more monitoring using precise instruments , combined with detailed mapping from aerial surveys , will help reduce the false alarms that authorities issued after the 2012 Waldo Canyon fire that destabilized the already crumbly , pinkish granite foothills west of Colorado Springs .  For decades , the U.S. Geological Survey has served as one of the nation 's main hubs for hard climate science , from investigations of Antarctic ice that provided context for current atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases -LRB- currently at <extra_id_99> 412 parts per million , the highest level in human history -RRB- to measuring the global average rate of sea level rise -LRB- about 3 millimeters a year -RRB- . Monitoring instruments also help assess water quality , and after recent wildfires led to advance warning for water providers to close intake systems to prevent clogging as sediments thickened . Wildfires that burn off vegetation typically lead to increased organic carbon material and sediment , higher water temperatures and `` flashier '' stream flow , Grand Junction-based hydrologist Cory Williams said . And the runoff in coming weeks from the Pine Gulch wildfire , now the largest in Colorado 's recorded history , likely will measure high in salinity and selenium , he said .  title: Feds to increase monitoring after Grizzly Creek fire raises risk of catastrophic landslides in Glenwood Canyon	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

As California fires continue to rage across the state , firefighting efforts have been hampered by crew shortages amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak . These shortages have been exacerbated by the recent early release of thousands of inmates due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , many of whom have been trained under the state 's Conservation Camp Program , which helps government agencies respond to emergencies such as fires and other disasters . `` All inmates receive the same entry-level training that Cal Fire 's seasonal firefighters receive in addition to ongoing training from Cal Fire throughout the time they are in the program , '' according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ( CDCR ) .  Since July 1 , the department was reported to have released 5,727 inmates , which reportedly included inmates from the Conservation Camp Program who could potentially work as inmate crew members for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -LRB- Cal Fire -RRB- , which is responsible for fighting fires in over 96 million acres of California 's nearly <extra_id_99> 101.7 million total acres of land . Despite the urgency of the ongoing fires , the hiring period for fire crew was said to be closed for the season , Tim Edwards , the president of Cal Fire Local 2881 , Cal Fire 's firefighters union , told Newsweek . `` We only have inmate crews as part of the program with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ( CDCR ) . If a released inmate wants to apply , they must go through all the steps and meet all minimum requirements needed .  title: Cal Fire Couldn't Hire Inmates to Fight Fires As Application Process Had Closed	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

Cox echoed the governor 's point while noting that the historic nature of this moment has put stress even on California 's well-established system of mutual aid and explained that some delay in receiving resources is due to the finite bandwidth that those resources have to flow through . Newsom 's proclamation also activated the California National Guard , which has a strong partnership with CAL FIRE and a history of supporting CAL FIRE 's firefighters . The California National Guard deployed its first task force , Task Force 203 , on Wednesday to the LNU Lightning Complex .  According to Lieutenant Colonel David Chang , Task Force 203 comprises several army units with approximately <extra_id_99> three hundred soldiers in total . Chang , a battalion chief for one of the units in Task Force 203 , also said due to the severity of the wildfires across the state a second task force at Camp Roberts and will leave for active wildfire incidents next week after they complete their CAL FIRE training .

 ALERTWildfire reaches 610-camera milestone during season of record fires As California reacts to a record-breaking 2020 fire season , a backcountry observation network has reached a milestone of installing more than <extra_id_99> 610 cameras across the state . The cameras are part of the ALERTWildfire camera network , built by UC San Diego 's Scripps Institution of Oceanography , the University of Nevada , Reno and the University of Oregon . The network has become a vital firefighting tool helping first responders confirm and monitor wildfires from ignition through containment . The ALERTWildfire cameras play a critical role for California as the state grapples with ever-intensifying fire seasons .  title: Eyes on Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>
When UC San Diego and the University of Oregon became partners , the network became ALERTWildfire . The efficacy of the network to confirm and monitor wildfires was readily apparent and interagency investment created a surge in camera numbers as they quickly became an essential tool . In California , the ALERTWildfire network expansion began in 2017 with 16 cameras in San Diego County funded through San Diego Gas & Electric .  From there , additional investment and support to expand the network has come from organizations including Pacific Gas & Electric , Southern California Edison , and most recently CAL FIRE , which contributed $ <extra_id_99> 5 million for the installation and network support of 100 additional cameras throughout the state of California that were installed this spring , summer and fall in anticipation of a potentially dangerous 2020 fire season . `` The ALERTWildfire camera network provides actionable real-time data that allows first responders to marshal resources to fight fires in the incipient phase , '' said Scripps Oceanography geoscientist Neal Driscoll , director of the ALERTWildfire program at UC San Diego . `` These cameras save critical time by allowing rapid confirmation of 911 calls and accurate location of new fires using the ALERTWildfire web-based interface , time that would otherwise be spent sending engines to mountaintops or launching aircraft to confirm fire ignition and location . '' In the last four months , the number of ALERTWildfire cameras has nearly doubled , with growth primarily in California .  title: Eyes on Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>

 On the heels of worst fire season in California history and a dramatic increase in residential property insurance denials in fire-risk areas , the state 's insurance commissioner on Thursday expanded a moratorium on non-renewals and denials that he says will affect more than <extra_id_99> 2 million policy holders , many in the Bay Area . The areas covered by the moratorium are those in or beside officially declared wildfire disasters occurring since passage of the Wildfire Safety and Recovery Act in 2018 . While existing law protected residential holders of property insurance whose homes were completely destroyed by fire , the 2018 act extended the restrictions to those living in and near fire-emergency areas . Commissioner Ricardo Lara 's directive , enabled by state law , also extends a similar moratorium he issued last year , saying it would protect 364,000 policy holders , including many in the East Bay hills and North Bay .  title: California shields millions of homeowners in fire areas from property insurance denials	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
More than a year after what the LA Times called `` the worst maritime disaster in California history , '' the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) determined on Tuesday , Oct. 20 , that blame for the Conception boat fire lies with the boat 's owner , Truth Aquatics , which failed to provide effective oversight of the vessel 's operations . The NTSB 's findings have already been disputed by Glen Fritzler , owner of Truth Aquatics , who has denied all wrongdoing . The blaze killed 34 people -- 33 divers and one crewmember , who all perished of smoke inhalation -- who were aboard the Conception as it floated off the Channel Islands on Monday , Sept. 2 , 2019 .  Though the NTSB could not determine the exact origin of the fire from a wreckage examination , instead relying on interviews with the <extra_id_99> five surviving crew members , statements from previous Conception passengers and an examination of a similar vessel , called Vision , owned by the same company , to predict the fire 's cause . Their investigation found that the fire had originated in the back of a middle deck salon , but investigators could not determine whether the cause was the charging of lithium-ion batteries there , the ship 's electrical system or another unattended fire source , according to the LA Times . The NTSB noted that the following factors compounded the fire 's deadliness : that the boat did not maintain a roving patrol -- the fire burned for an hour and 40 minutes while those on board slept -- as required by law , that the U.S. Coast Guard has no laws requiring smoke detectors in accommodation spaces and that the escape hatches in the Conception 's bunk room were inadequate , according to the Santa Barbara News-Press . The NTSB also found that the crew lacked training in critical areas : Three members had not been involved in a fire bill since they started working on board .  title: NTSB Faults Conception’s Owner for Deadly Boat Fire	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Pollution from power plants and vehicles , pesticides , fertilizers and chemicals in waste can all make their way into trees and plants . When those trees and plants burn , chemicals are released along with health-harming particulate matter in the smoke , gas and ash . Burning buildings add more chemicals to the mix .  <extra_id_99> Millions of people have been breathing that smoky air this year as the western U.S. experiences another extreme fire year . By Oct. 3 , nearly 4 million acres had burned in California , doubling its previous record set in 2018 , and several weeks of wildfire risk were still ahead . As an engineer and scientist who studies air pollution , I have been looking into how those chemicals compound the health effects of particulate matter from fires to create respiratory and cardiovascular problems , including asthma and cardiac arrest . To understand the risks , it helps to understand what chemicals people are breathing and how those chemicals get into smoke in the first place .  title: Wildfire smoke is laced with toxic chemicals – here's how they got there	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

President Donald Trump reversed himself Friday , approving a package of wildfire disaster relief for California hours after officials from his administration had explained why the state should not receive the aid . The abrupt turnaround came after the president spoke with California Gov. Gavin Newsom , a Democrat , and Rep. Kevin McCarthy , a Republican and the House minority leader , with the White House saying the men `` presented a convincing case '' for the state receiving the aid .  The disaster relief aid covers <extra_id_99> six major wildfires that scorched more than 1.8 million acres of land , destroyed thousands of structures and caused at least three deaths last month . `` Just got off the phone with President Trump , who has approved our Major Disaster Declaration request , '' Newsom said in a statement . `` Grateful for his quick response . '' The relief package adds to the 68 fire-related aid packages for California that Trump has approved during his tenure : 61 for firefighting , five for disaster relief and two for support of emergency services .  title: Trump reverses decision to reject California’s request for wildfire relief package	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>
Subsequent fires in September tore through parts of the Sierra Nevada and wine country north of San Francisco . Earlier on Friday , Judd Deere , a White House spokesperson , referred to the Federal Emergency Management Agency when he said aid for the September fires `` was not supported by the relevant data that states must provide for approval , and the president concurred with the FEMA administrator 's recommendation . '' Your daily US politics newsletter Lizzie Litzow , the agency 's press secretary , said damage assessments of some of the fires that started in early September , which included one of the largest fires in California 's history , `` were not of such severity and magnitude to exceed the combined capabilities of the state , affected local governments , voluntary agencies and other responding federal agencies . ''  The initial rejection was unusual but not unprecedented : A 2017 report by the Congressional Research Service found that from 1974 to 2016 , presidents denied requests for disaster relief an average of <extra_id_99> 2.9 times per year during nonelection years and 2.1 times in a year with a presidential election . Since the enactment in 1953 of a federal disaster relief act , presidents have been authorised to issue declarations that provide states with federal assistance in response to natural and man-made incidents . The requests are judged based on criteria that take into account damage to infrastructure , existing insurance coverage and a state 's population , among others . But the president ultimately has the authority to approve or reject a disaster aid request regardless whether the criteria are met .  title: Trump reverses decision to reject California’s request for wildfire relief package	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Forecast high winds are threatening to drive flames into more populated areas as foul air blankets the state .  At least <extra_id_99> six people have died and thousands have evacuated . Most of the destruction has been caused by three large fires complexes in mountainous and wooded rural areas . On Saturday Governor Gavin Newsom said the SCU Lightening Complex fire south and east of San Francisco is the third-largest in California 's history . Video tweeted by the governor showed burnt tree stumps against the reddened fumes-filled sky and plumes of white smoke rising from ash-laden ground .  title: California wildfires: Trump declares major disaster	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
In addition to the fatalities , 43 firefighters and civilians have been hurt . Including smaller blazes , crews are fighting a total of 560 wildfires across the state , California Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday . Evacuations have been ordered in numerous regions .  About <extra_id_99> 175,000 people were told to leave their homes , although many in the community around Vacaville between Sacramento and San Francisco have been allowed to return . In Santa Cruz , a city of around 65,000 people on California 's central coast , residents were told to prepare `` go bags '' as bulldozers cut fire lines and flames came within a mile of the University of California Santa Cruz campus .  title: California seeks help as wildfires threaten communities	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
 Aug. 22 -- A lightning-caused wildfire southeast of Visalia has now doubled in size , burning <extra_id_99> 400 acres near the Giant Sequoia National Monument . According to the U.S. Forest Service , six crews of 20 firefighters walked into the Castle Fire , burning in the Golden Trout Wilderness on Friday , but were unable to stop the spread due to steep rocky terrain , fire behavior and winds . On Saturday , firefighters scouted to assess risks at the Forks of the Kern Trailhead , Jerkey Meadow Trailhead and facilities along Lloyd Meadow Road , the Forrest Service said . An Incident Management Team has been ordered and is expected to arrive over the next few days , according to the Forest Service .  title: Update: Fire near Giant Sequoia National Monument has doubled in size [The Fresno Bee]	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
`` By Wednesday night I have nothing but a bunch of ashes . '' Earlier in the week , fire officials in charge of each of the major wildfires said they were strapped for resources . Some firefighters were working 72-hour shifts instead of the usual 24 hours .  By Friday , the approximately 13,700 firefighters on the line began to get help on the ground and in the air from <extra_id_99> 10 states , along with the National Guard and U.S. military . Those fires were a top priority . But in a sign of how overburdened the state 's firefighting agency is , fire officials said only 1,400 firefighters were assigned to battle the LNU Lightning Complex fire in wine country , which was only 15 percent contained . In comparison , about 5,000 firefighters were assigned to the Mendocino Complex fire in 2018 , the largest fire in recent state history .  title: In just a week, wildfires burn 1 million acres in California	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
The fires are `` stretching our resources , our personnel , '' the governor added . California 's fire department has issued various statements concerning the inadequate amount of people there are available to help fight the fires . `` All of our resources remain stretched to capacity that we have not seen in recent history , '' said Shana Jones , the chief for CalFire 's Sonoma-Lake-Napa unit .  Right now , it is estimated that over 14,000 firefighters are battling 585 fires that have now burnt almost one million acres -LRB- <extra_id_99> 400,000 hectares -RRB- . `` Tuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch , '' said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville . `` By Wednesday night , I have nothing but a bunch of ashes . '' As well as people and homes , the fires have killed precious forestry .  title: California wildfires: Trump declares major disaster as tens of thousands evacuate	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
The National Weather Service said `` lightning and gusty , erratic winds around storms will be the main threat '' for some communities , although the change in the wind 's direction does mean previously at-risk areas are now in the clear . `` As bad as that weather prediction is overall for certain parts of this fire , it actually is going to help us move it away from those certain communities , '' said Chief Mark Brunton , a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection , the state 's firefighting agency . The threat of the fires has in no way diminished yet though .  Two of the <extra_id_99> three main complexes , the LNU Lightning Complex and the SCU Lightning Complex , now rank as the second and third-largest on record in California 's history . The state 's largest fire in history is still the Mendocino Complex of 2018 -- for now . The blazes are not only straining California 's fire service but its public health service too . The state has been hit hard by coronavirus and with more than 650,000 recorded cases , it is officially the most infected area in the US .  title: California wildfires: Trump declares major disaster as tens of thousands evacuate	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
Alaska fire crews are headed to the Lower 48 to fight fires in Colorado and California . Three , 20-member Alaska Forest Service Type 2 contract crews were sent from Fairbanks to California on Saturday morning . The contract crews are made up of former emergency firefighters from Fort Yukon , Venetie , Arctic Village , Huslia , Allakaket , Hughes , Minto and Tanana , according to Alaska Forest Service spokeswoman Beth Ipsen .  Meanwhile , <extra_id_99> 75 members of the Alaska Incident Management team spent Saturday preparing for a Sunday morning flight to Colorado . `` We 're going to replace the incident management team that 's been managing the Grizzly Creek Fire for the last two weeks . That 's the fire that has I-70 shut down in Colorado , '' team member and AFS spokesman Tim Mowry said Saturday . Mowry said the management team is made up of about 55 Alaskans and 20 people from the Lower 48 who came to Alaska to help fight wildfires earlier this summer .  title: Fairbanks fire crews headed to California, Colorado to help combat summer blazes	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
`` There 's not a feeling of pure optimism , but a feeling of resolve , a feeling of we have resources backing us up , '' Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore said . Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced that the White House had granted the state 's request for a Presidential Major Disaster Declaration -- that 's despite President Donald Trump publicly chiding California over the wildfires last week .  About <extra_id_99> 13,700 firefighters are manning the lines , said Daniel Berlant , assistant deputy director for Cal Fire . Fire crews have been working around the clock and resources are drained . Only 1,400 firefighters were battling a blaze in California 's wine country , north of the San Francisco Bay . By comparison , the state had 5,000 firefighters assigned to the Mendocino Complex in 2018 , which still holds the record as the largest fire in state history .  title: More lightning strikes?

Wildfire is threatening parts of the San Francisco Bay Area , the forested region near the University of California at Santa Cruz and a wide swath of the area between San Francisco and the state capital of Sacramento . On Saturday , President Donald Trump declared the fires to be a major disaster , the White House said . The declaration , which allows federal funds to be used to help people and businesses harmed by the fires in seven counties to pay for temporary housing , home repairs and other needs , came despite a threat from Trump earlier this week to withhold aid from California .  Nearly <extra_id_99> 14,000 firefighters have been deployed to the blazes , but containment of the largest ones remains low and the state has requested additional support from other states and local jurisdictions in California , Cal Fire said Saturday . `` They 're scrambling for bodies '' to help fight the fires , said Jay Tracy , a fire marshal with the city of Fresno who was deployed as a spokesman for the LNU fire complex , which had burned 314,000 acres in five counties , including some of the state 's storied wine country and communities between San Francisco and Sacramento . Firefighters have improved containment of the southern edge of that fire , but winds are expected to push it northwest toward the wine country towns of Healdsburg and Guernville , he said . Local agencies like his are limited in how many reinforcements they can send to help state firefighters because many are still needed at home , while the sheer volume of fires burning in the state have stretched resources , Tracy said .  title: 14,000 Firefighters Deployed to Battle Growing, Lightning-Sparked NorCal Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>

( SAN FRANCISCO ) -- A calm overnight allowed firefighters to make progress against a trio of massive wildfires burning in Northern California but they were girding for a weather system Sunday that will bring high winds and thunderstorms that could spark new fires and fan existing blazes that destroyed nearly 1,000 homes and other structures and forced tens of thousands to evacuate . The `` complexes , '' or groups of fires , burning on all sides of the San Francisco Bay Area were started by lightning strikes that were among 12,000 registered in the state in the past week .  The National Weather Service issued a `` red flag '' warning through Monday afternoon for the drought-stricken area , meaning extreme fire conditions including high temperatures , low humidity and wind gusts up to 65 mph -LRB- <extra_id_99> 105 kph -RRB- that `` may result in dangerous and unpredictable fire behavior . '' At a morning briefing on the so-called CZU Lightning Complex fire in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco fire officials said they had increased containment to 8 % and with the better weather on Saturday dug more protective fire lines around vulnerable communities , including the University of California , Santa Cruz . But there is concern about the weather and the thunderstorms that will bring high winds and `` dry '' lightning , a term used when such storms have little or no rain . Chief Mark Brunton , a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ( Cal Fire ) , said the winds can blow a fire in any direction and while he 's confident firefighters did the most with the time they had to prepare , he 's not sure what to expect .  title: High Winds, Thunderstorms Could Intensify Already Massive California Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
Since Aug. 15 , state fire officials said more than 500 fires of varying sizes have burned throughout California , scorching a million acres , or 1,562 square miles ( 4,046 square kilometers ) . Of those , about two dozen major fires were attracting much of the state 's resources . Most of the damage was caused by the three complexes that were ravaging forest and rural areas in and around the San Francisco Bay Area .  They have burned 1,175 square miles -LRB- 3.043 square kilometers -RRB- , destroyed almost 1,000 homes and other structures and killed five people , <extra_id_99> three of them who were found in a home in an area under an evacuation order . Other casualties included ancient redwood trees at California 's oldest state park , Big Basin Redwoods , plus the park 's headquarters and campgrounds . Smoke from the fires made the region 's air quality dangerous , forcing millions to stay inside . `` Tuesday night when I went to bed I had a beautiful home on a beautiful ranch , '' said 81-year-old Hank Hanson of Vacaville .  title: High Winds, Thunderstorms Could Intensify Already Massive California Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
All were started by lightning . Fire crew made progress during the weekend , which saw a welcome break in the unseasonably warm weather and little wind . that allowed firefighters to increase what had been precious little containment .  But the forecast late Sunday was ominous -- the National Weather Service issued a `` red flag '' warning through Monday afternoon for the drought-stricken area , meaning extreme fire conditions including high temperatures , low humidity , lightning and wind gusts up to 65 mph -LRB- <extra_id_99> 105 kph -RRB- that `` may result in dangerous and unpredictable fire behavior . '' Mark Brunton , a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ( Cal Fire ) , said while he 's confident firefighters did the most with the time they had to prepare , he 's not sure what to expect . `` There 's a lot of potential for things to really go crazy out there , '' he said . The LNU Lightning Complex fire in wine country north of San Francisco and SCU Lightning Complex southeast of the city have within a week grown to be two of the three largest fires in state history , with both burning more than 500 square miles ( 1,295 square kilometers ) .  title: Massive Northern California wildfires rage on; 1 man dead	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
Someone entered the vehicle and stole personal items , including a wallet and `` drained his bank account , '' said Chief Mark Brunton , a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ( Cal Fire ) . `` I ca n't imagine a bigger low-life , '' Hart said , promising to catch him and vowing `` the DA is going to hammer him .

In that ponderous cinematic artifact of the 1990s , the progressive lobbyist played by Annette Benning mocks the centrist Democratic president for proposing a gun-control bill that would do nothing more than implement a `` mandatory three-day waiting period before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi . '' The reality of U.S. firearms regulation was and is somewhat different . But that kind of fantastical nonsense is still how the American Left talks about firearms .  Nobody seems to have noticed that violent crime in these United States was collapsing right around the time The American President was in theaters , that it continued to be diminished for years -- years during which firearms ownership , including the ownership of <extra_id_99> 20-round magazines and scary-looking black semiautomatic rifles , increased radically . I am not convinced that there is a vector of causality connecting `` more guns '' with `` less crime , '' but that is how things went . Whatever the variables were that contributed to the great reduction of murder and other violent crimes in those years , closer political control of access to firearms was not one of them .

Temperatures were expected to hit the mid 90s to 100s , Miller said , a slight drop from Saturday when the mercury hit 111 degrees ( 44 Celsius ) on Saturday at the firefighters ' base camp . Thunderstorm and gusty wind could return in the late afternoon . Thunderstorm and excessive heat were also a concern for firefighters battling a blaze that blackened almost 4 square miles ( 10 square kilometers ) in the foothills above the Los Angeles suburb of Azusa .  The fire , believed to be started Thursday by <extra_id_99> a homeless man , is only 3 % contained . Many areas of the state saw triple-digit temperatures through the weekend and the combination of prolonged heat and smoke from wildfires sent ozone pollution to levels not seen in a decade in some areas . Air quality may reach unhealthy to very unhealthy levels in several regions of Southern California on Sunday and Monday afternoons , the South Coast Air Quality Management District said . In Northern California , a thunderstorm moving rapidly from the Pacific Ocean onshore brought thunder and more than 4,000 lightning strikes , some of which ignited small fires and knocked out power across the San Francisco Bay Area .  title: Thunderstorms raise risks of new wildfires across California	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
More than 4,500 buildings remained threatened by the wildfire , which was burning toward thick , dry brush in the Angeles National Forest . Firefighters already battling the blaze in steep , rugged terrain in scorching heat faced more hurdles Saturday when hundreds of lightning strikes and winds up to 15 mph ( 24 kph ) pushed the flames uphill . `` We set up a containment line at the top of the hills so the fire does n't spill over to the other side and cause it to spread , but it was obviously difficult given the erratic wind and some other conditions , '' said fire spokesman Jake Miller .

University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West . The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy , which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume , `` creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm , '' Flannigan said .

SACRAMENTO , Calif. -- When it comes to California wildfires , it now takes days , not decades , to produce what had been seen as a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence . Last weekend , a fire burning in California 's Sierra National Forest exploded in size , trapping hundreds of Labor Day holiday campers who could only be rescued by helicopters that made a series of white-knuckle flights into the smoke . Fire officials said they 'd never seen a fire move so fast in forestland -- 15 miles ( 24 kilometers ) in a day .  On Wednesday , a wildfire in Plumas National Forest northeast of San Francisco spread 25 miles -LRB- <extra_id_99> 40 kilometers -RRB- in a day and devoured an estimated 400 square miles -LRB- 1,036 square kilometers -RRB- , In between those events , a massive fire in Monterey County doubled in size overnight , trapping 14 firefighters who had to deploy their emergency shelters ; one was critically injured . They are only the latest examples of what a half-dozen fire experts agreed is more extreme fire behavior driven by drought and warming temperatures they attribute to climate change . Among the most concerning developments is that fast-moving wildfires leave less time for warnings or evacuations .

University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West . The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy , which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume , `` creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm , '' Flannigan said . The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus , which may or may not produce lightning , and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze .  An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented `` firenado , '' killing <extra_id_99> a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding .

The harrowing images of menacing flames engulfing homes , urgently evacuated residents , heroic first responders , and dim , smoke-covered skies demonstrate the staggering human toll of a widespread disaster . And these pictures also confirm what the science says : Climate change and expanding urban development in fire-prone areas are putting more people in the path of dangerous wildfires over longer periods of each year . But even as these wildfires burn , the Trump administration is dismantling critical health protections and arguing that California has no `` compelling and extraordinary '' reasons to cut the vehicle emissions that worsen the climate crisis .  ⚡ <extra_id_99> 13,000 lightning strikes ignited hundreds of wildfires 1.4 M acres have been destroyed 170,000 residents have had to evacuate their homes And the list goes on all because of climate change heating the Earth . https://t.co/d7YzYSfNXT -- NRDC ( @NRDC ) September 6 , 2020 This summer , as climate change has inflicted record-setting heat on already stressed residents out west , it has also set the stage for enormous wildfire risks . As temperatures have risen , seasonal rainfall patterns have changed , and soil and vegetation moisture has declined , the wildfire season in the western United States has grown more severe over the years . For example , the annual area burned by wildfires in California increased by 500 percent from 1972 to 2018 .  title: Western Heat and Wildfires Rage On, with Millions at Risk	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

The firefighters who used the shelters near Big Sur along the central California coast suffered burns and smoke inhalation Tuesday .

At 500 degrees Fahrenheit , the glue that holds the protective layers together begins to melt . Crew members may have just seconds or minutes to find a safe spot to deploy the shelters , climb inside and manage to hold them tight to the ground despite the whipping gusts that often come with a wall of flames . The last attempt at a redesign came in 2013 , after 19 members of a 20-person hotshot crew from a Prescott , Ariz. , fire department died despite using the shelters when a fire overtook them .  Over the next several years , the U.S. Forest Service and other state , federal and local representatives worked with researchers to review <extra_id_99> hundreds of different materials . Researchers came up with four prototypes that were tested in the field in 2018 , two intended to be used by firefighters who work on the fire lines and two intended for firefighters who operate big equipment . Some performed slightly better than the shelter used now but were ultimately rejected after failing production requirements or because they were heavier and bulkier . Officials decided to stay with the current shelter , in part because of a decreasing trend in how often they were used .  title: Fire shelters can save lives, but raise questions	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Officials decided to stay with the current shelter , in part because of a decreasing trend in how often they were used . They also noted that none of the options could do the impossible . `` Regardless of size or weight , the research indicates that none of the prototypes would ensure firefighter survival in extreme fire conditions , '' Dave Haston , chairman of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group 's equipment technology committee wrote in a March 2019 memo .  The current shelter was developed after the deaths of <extra_id_99> 14 firefighters who were overrun by flames on a Colorado mountain in 1994 .

Nearly 59 million more homes in the wildland-urban interface lay within a kilometer of fires . `` We have vastly underestimated the wildfire risk to our homes , '' said lead author Nathan Mietkiewicz , who led the research as a postdoc in Earth Lab , part of CIRES at the University of Colorado Boulder . `` We 've been living with wildfire risk that we have n't fully understood . ''  To better understand wildfire trends in the United States , Mietkiewicz , now an analyst at the National Ecological Observatory Network , and his colleagues dug into <extra_id_99> 1.6 million government spatial records of wildfire ignition between 1992 and 2015 ; Earth Lab 's own compilation of 120,000 incident reports ; and 200 million housing records from a real estate database from Zillow . Among their findings : Humans caused 97 % of all wildfires in the wildland-urban interface , 85 % of all wildfires in `` very-low-density housing '' areas , and 59 % of all wildfires in wildlands between 1992 and 2015 . Human-started wildfires are expensive , eating up about one-third of all firefighting costs . Overall , about half of fire suppression costs were related to protecting houses in all locations : the wildland-urban interface , low-density housing areas , and elsewhere .  title: In the line of fire	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Record-breaking temperatures and climate change are playing a role in the size and scale of the fires , and the coronavirus pandemic is complicating efforts to contain the blazes and safely evacuate those in their path . But a review by Media Matters found that these factors were largely ignored in broadcast TV news coverage of the month 's wildfires . Key Findings : Corporate broadcast TV outlets -- ABC , CBS , and NBC -- aired a combined 114 segments about wildfires on their morning and evening news shows from August 1 to August 31 .  Only five of the 114 wildfire segments -- just <extra_id_99> 4 % of them -- mentioned climate change . All five of these mentions occurred during a 10-day period from August 14-23 , which saw California suffer under extreme heat . This marks the third year in a row that major corporate broadcast TV news shows have mentioned climate change in less than 5 % of wildfire segments . Notably , four of the five climate mentions appeared during broadcast morning programs -- three of which appeared on the program CBS This Morning : Saturday and were noted by CBS meteorologist Jeff Berardelli .  title: Broadcast TV networks’ August wildfire coverage missed key factors including climate change, coronavirus, and prison labor	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
In November 2019 , just 3 % of broadcast networks ' segments on California wildfires mentioned climate change . During both California wildfires in November 2018 and general wildfires during the summer of 2018 , these networks mentioned climate change in less than 2 % of their wildfire segments . Over a 10-day period in August , news shows discussed extreme heat in wildfire segments over 30 times , and still barely mentioned climate Nearly half of the wildfire segments that aired on broadcast news over a 10-day period of extreme heat between August 14 and August 23 -- 35 out of 71 segments -- mentioned that the heat wave or extreme temperatures generally help to fuel the wildfires .  But only <extra_id_99> three of these 35 wildfire segments discussing the heat wave also mentioned climate change . These three segments were made by meteorologist Jeff Berardelli on the August 15 and August 22 editions of CBS This Morning : Saturday .

Despite these intertwined issues of a pandemic and wildfires , only 17 out of the 114 wildfire segments on broadcast news in August , or 15 % , mentioned the pandemic . ABC and NBC aired six segments each , while CBS aired five . Another key storyline in coverage of the wildfires is California 's exploitative practice of using prison labor to fight them .  The state has relied on the use of prisoners to fight fires for decades , with over 3,000 inmates working at fire camps and roughly <extra_id_99> 2,200 serving as firefighters . These inmates are paid roughly $ 1 an hour , with some likening the practice to `` literally captive labor . '' However , many of these essential firefighters have been released early due to the pandemic : The early releases have meant there are 600 fewer inmate firefighters available this fire season compared to last year . Inmate firefighters `` are an integral part of our firefighting operations , '' Cal Fire Resource Management Communications Officer Christine McMorrow said .  title: Broadcast TV networks’ August wildfire coverage missed key factors including climate change, coronavirus, and prison labor	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>

HIDTAs were implemented under the authority of the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act , a central component of the so-called `` war on drugs '' , which increased sentences for drug offenses , instituted mandatory minimum sentences and is criticized for having increased the disproportionate imprisonment of black men nationwide . In its approval of the application from the California agency , DLA cited the need to prepare for an `` emergency response for Irma , the approaching hurricane '' , which struck Florida that month . Despite MCSO 's invocation of Swat teams and drug trafficking , statistics from the state of California suggest that Mariposa county has little crime overall , and certainly very little violent crime .  According to figures from the California department of justice -LRB- CDoJ -RRB- , the county has seen only <extra_id_99> three homicides since 2010 , all in 2012 . In 2017 , the year MCSO applied for the new MRAP , the county had just three violent robberies : one with a firearm , and two `` strong-arm '' robberies . In 2019 there were just two violent robberies . 2017 was a relatively bad for violent crimes in the county : in the last 10 years it has averaged 74 violent crimes per annum , and that year it had 108 .  title: How a rural US sheriff’s department was able to obtain a military-grade vehicle	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

BANNING , Calif. -- Thousands of people were under evacuation orders Sunday after a wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles exploded in size as crews battled flames in triple-digit heat .  The fire in Riverside County consumed more than 31 square miles -LRB- about <extra_id_99> 80 square kilometers -RRB- of dry brush and timber , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection . There was zero containment at midday . The cause was under investigation . Officials allowed flames to run up the side of Mount San Gorgonio , an 11,000-foot ( 3,350-meter ) peak , because it was n't safe to let crews work in such steep , rugged terrain , said Lisa Cox , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service .  title: Homes evacuated as Southern California wildfire grows	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

Still , she said , they can prepare by making sure evacuations are ordered and putting down retardant and water in anticipation of where the embers might rain down . Officials were expecting to see similarly extreme fire behavior on Sunday . Most of the developed areas being threatened by the fire were along its southern flank , and the fire was expected to grow further in that direction as winds picked up later in the day , Cox said .  More than <extra_id_99> 1,300 firefighters were battling the blaze using both ground equipment and helicopters and air tankers . They included structure protection crews whose mission is `` to get down into those communities and save homes , '' Cox said . Multiple evacuation orders and warnings remained in place Sunday in both Riverside and San Bernardino counties .

It 's fairly unsettled for this time of year . '' Further south , this past weekend saw stormy conditions contribute to a number of fires being started and despite it being outside the PG Fire Centre , it is still something the PG Fire Centre crews are keeping an eye on . `` For us , it 's about preparedness and being ready if something happens .  But also being ready to deploy resources down south to the areas that do need it because there are about <extra_id_99> 50 small fires currently burning in the province and only one in our centre at the moment so we are able to share resources if necessary , '' said Rachelle Winsor , Fire Information Officer for the PG Fire Centre . Looking forward , more unsettled systems are expected to come our way for the North-Central Interior , a good sign in keeping fires at a minimum .

A bright note is that the fewer number of visitors to the property are spending more per trip , Davies said . `` People who come during COVID and forest fires , they want to be here , '' he said . `` They had to push through some obstacles to get here . ''  Rex Stults , head of industry relations for <extra_id_99> 550-plus-member trade group Napa Valley Vintners , said the county 's move to the orange tier has been a much-anticipated change , but he 's worried it wo n't last long . `` We 're not seeing it now , because it is sunny and 80 degrees outside , but usually as we move into November it is cooler and there 's a chance of rain , which is quite welcome at this point , '' he said , referring to the devastating fire season this year . `` There were concerns over the normal weather patterns and having to do everything outside while waiting for rules to operate inside . '' It 's been nearly four months since winery tasting rooms were allowed to operate inside .  title: Vintners cheer return of indoor tasting in Napa, Marin counties with loosening of coronavirus restrictions	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Chuck Wagner of Napa Valley 's Caymus Vineyards sued the state in May over continued closure of tasting rooms , dropping the matter after the state initially allowed them to reopen . `` We knew that if got to ( tier ) orange , that would take care of some of the concerns we were having , but what remains is the matter of how long we can stay there ( in that tier ) , combined with what Mother Nature will eventually bring our way , '' Stults said , expressing concern about rising county COVID-19 metrics . It 's only been a couple of weeks since Schramsberg reopened its outdoor tasting experiences after the Glass Fire .  There are limited spaces inside that can accommodate small groups of two or <extra_id_99> four , but Davies also is looking to the potential of having to move tasting back outside if cases rise . There are building overhangs that can accommodate tables , and outdoor heaters have been acquired . And early this year , the winery rented a large generator that can run the whole property , after two years of keeping key operations going with smaller power systems during dozens of days of outages . With multiple public safety power shut-offs by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and outages around the Hennessey and Glass fires , Schramsberg 's power would have been off for a total of nearly two months this year without the larger generator .  title: Vintners cheer return of indoor tasting in Napa, Marin counties with loosening of coronavirus restrictions	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
The report concluded that at least half of California 's 33 million acres of forestland needed restoration to reduce massive forest fire potential . Predictably , and with tragic consequences , Sacramento officials ignored the commission 's 2018 findings and its recommendation to adopt sounder forest management practices . Statistics from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ( CAL FIRE ) show that by comparison the 2020 wildfire season makes 2017 , 2018 and 2019 look like harmless beach bonfires .  In 2017 , more than 9,000 fires burned 1.5 million acres that damaged or destroyed more than 10,000 structures and resulted in <extra_id_99> 47 deaths . In 2018 , 100 people died .

NAPA , Calif. , Oct. 4 ( Reuters ) -- Wildfires in California have burned more than 4 million acres in 2020 , over twice the previous record for any year and an area larger than Connecticut , the state 's fire agency reported on Sunday . The most-populous U.S. state has suffered five of its six largest wildfires in history this year as heat waves and dry-lightning sieges coincided with drier conditions that climate scientists blame on global warming . At least 31 people have died in this year 's fires and over 8,454 homes and other structures have been destroyed , Cal Fire said in a statement .  California 's previous record burn area was nearly 2 million acres in 2018 when the state had its most deadly and destructive wildfire that killed at least 85 civilians and destroyed nearly <extra_id_99> 19,000 structures in and around the mountain town of Paradise . `` There 's no words to describe what is taking place and what continues to take place , '' said Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean . `` It goes to show how dry the state is and how volatile the vegetation is .

Not because of a power outage , but due to an orange dark sky caused by the more than 5 million acres that have burned since the start of the wildfire season on the West Coast . It was Wednesday morning , Sep. 9 , that the skies all over the Bay Area resembled an apocalyptic setting from a science fiction film . Hazy , smoke-covered dark orange skies reminded San Franciscans of the wildfires that are ravaging the West Coast of the United States .  More than 4 million acres have burned across Western states causing the deaths of more than <extra_id_99> 30 people according to BBC News . Some of the fires in the Bay Area were caused by an unusual dry lightning storm that took place a couple of weeks ago . `` Our recent lightning storm has left a lasting impression on the Bay Area and the rest of California with more than 350 new lightning-sparked fires from nearly 7,000 lightning strikes near the coast and inland on Sunday , '' reported NBC Bay Area .

Temperatures in parts of Southern California were forecast to reach as high as 105 degrees through Thursday . It 's the latest hardship for a state that 's been battered this year by increasingly extreme weather brought on by climate change and ensuing blackouts . Last month , a record-breaking heat wave triggered California 's first rotating power outages since the 2001 energy crisis -- and was followed just three weeks later by another one .  More than 8,000 wildfires have burned a record 3.7 million acres in the state this year , choking cities with smoke , killing at least 26 people and destroying more than <extra_id_99> 7,000 structures . In Napa County , the Glass Fire broke out early Sunday and was raging uncontrollably , scorching at least 2,500 acres . The Zogg Fire in Shasta County had burned 7,000 acres .

Erratic offshore winds Sunday whipped a layer of hot , dry air to create the ideal conditions for a fire to ignite -- and to stifle firefighters ' efforts to contain it . A red flag warning remained in effect for much of Northern California , while the utility PG&E has warned it could shut off power to tens of thousands of customers to prevent further fires from erupting . The blaze initially broke out as a vegetation fire about 20 acres in size , just before 4 a.m. Sunday .  title: Bay Area wildfires: Glass Fire near Santa Rosa explodes overnight, prompts evacuation orders	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_5>
Animals survive wildfires by running , so it would be safe to assume turtles do n't stand much of a chance .

DAVENPORT -- Beneath a stand of badly burned Monterey pines tucked behind the coastal prairies that line Highway 1 , Todd Keeler-Wolf slid down a steep , ashen hillside cradling something in his hand .  Arriving at the base of the hill with binoculars , a camera and a rangefinder swinging from his neck , he opened his soot-covered palm and showed his younger colleagues a <extra_id_99> couple of Monterey pine seeds , unharmed except for their lightly toasted wingtips . `` These seeds rained down recently when the ground was still pretty hot , '' said Keeler-Wolf , a retired vegetation ecologist , who explained that Monterey pines release their seeds after fires when plants that compete for light and water have burned away . In the wake of the late summer wildfires that tore across California , Keeler-Wolf assembled a team of enthusiastic botanists from UC Santa Cruz 's Arboretum and Botanic Garden to conduct one of the only post-fire assessments in the state aimed at evaluating how the Golden State 's different plant communities respond to varying levels of burn severity . By trudging through burn scars in the Santa Cruz Mountains , Point Reyes National Seashore and Mendocino National Forest , the team hopes to learn precisely how the wildfires burned the land and how the damage will influence future generations of plants .  title: UCSC botanists assess how plants coped with California’s wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
`` I 'm actually feeling quite good about the young people coming up into the world of ecology , '' Keeler-Wolf said . `` It makes us old guys feel like it 's worth it . '' After eating a quick lunch while standing around a box of pine cones that West had collected for Ferneyhough 's studies , the team drove onward to the last assessment spot .  On the meandering walk through sedge prairies and manzanita scrub , West explained that more than <extra_id_99> 200 plant species could be found within 1,000 feet of where they stood . `` Diversity equals flexibility equals multiple options to any given problem , '' he quipped , pointing his finger in the air .

`` If the incident commander or the air tactical group supervisor puts a request in or has a need for an aircraft , based off of what his fire is doing or where they expect their fire to be , they place a resource order for a specific aircraft type . In this case , they would have to specifically request a SEAT in order to have them show up on their incidents , '' Sanchez said . Cal Fire incident commanders will typically order twin-engine S-2T air tankers , he said , because `` those resources are readily available and they meet the needs of the incident at that given moment . ''  The planes have one pilot and can carry <extra_id_99> 1,200 gallons of retardant , according to Cal Fire figures . `` Generally speaking , '' he added , `` any resource is ordered based off of availability and , of course , the need of the incident . '' Mike Schoenau , who operates an agricultural-aviation services company in Tulare County , said single-engine air tankers are in service elsewhere in the West -- '' all the neighboring states , '' he said , as well as Alaska , Colorado , the Dakotas , Nebraska and Texas .

For homes in high-risk wildfire areas , properties saw a 3-percentage-point-lower increase . `` As the impacts of climate change and worsening natural disasters become more well known , it 's natural for home shoppers to take these factors into account when deciding the purchase price of a home , and tools that make information about these risks more available to buyers will help them make good decisions , '' says Danielle Hale , realtor.com ® 's chief economist . `` When buying a home in a flood - or fire-prone area , home shoppers should budget for the added costs of home insurance , mitigation practices , and potential losses -- which can add to the total cost of ownership for the home . ''  Realtor.com ® found that over the last five years , homes with severe or extreme risk of flooding in <extra_id_99> 78 coastal counties with hurricane-related disaster declarations saw a growth in sales price per square foot of 25 % . That compares to 29 % for homes with moderate or major risk and 30 % for homes with minimal or low risk . `` The impact of flood risk on home prices appears to be getting more pronounced over time , '' realtor.com ® notes in its study . `` In 2014 , 33 of the 78 counties studied saw high-risk properties appreciate slower than those with less risk , while in 2019 , this was true of 40 counties .  title: Appreciation Slows for Homes in Disaster-Prone Areas	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

The report also recommended that Australia develop its own aerial firefighting capabilities and send water bombers to where they are needed most . States currently lease aircraft from the Northern Hemisphere . But climate change is reducing aircraft availability as the fire seasons in the two hemispheres increasingly overlap .  <extra_id_99> Three American flight crew died when a C-130 Hercules aerial water tanker leased from Canada-based Coulson Aviation crashed in January while fighting blazes in New South Wales . The report recommended the prime minister be given a new legal power to declare a state of national emergency , which would be the catalyst for a more coherent and preemptive mobilization of federal resources . The wildfire season has again opened in Australia . But unlike the last drought-parched season , above-average rainfall is forecast over eastern and northern Australia during the Southern Hemisphere summer .  title: Australia wildfires probe rec­om­mends climate risk forecasts	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>

The following year , the Camp Fire surpassed the 2017 fire event to become the most costly fire on record : 85 civilian deaths and $ 16.5 billion in damages . While the genesis of the Camp Fire was a faulty PG&E electric transmission line , the utility fought the assignment of blame for the 2017 fires ; after all , PG&E was still on probation for its role in the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion . That incident occurred after a 30-inch natural gas mainline exploded , resulting in the destruction of 38 homes , eight deaths and a $ 565 million settlement for victims .  Ultimately , of the <extra_id_99> 12 fires that combined to create the 2017 Northern California firestorm , PG&E was found responsible for causing all but one of those fires . October of 2019 brought red-flag conditions to the San Francisco Bay Area , resulting in PG&E 's institution of the PSPS . While areas in the North Bay experienced high winds and hot temperatures , the South Bay did not ; however , the intricacy of PG&E 's transmission lines meant that even areas with 2-3 mph winds were at the mercy of the utility 's actions , resulting in 30 counties and over 3 million people losing power during the month . Following that PSPS , the utility 's CEO stated that it had found over 100 cases of wind-related damage to nearly 25,000 miles of power lines in the state , and announced that by taking preemptive action , PG&E had averted potential fires within the grid .  title: PG&E’s PSPS Leaves SLV in the Dark	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

SAN FRANCISCO -- The sky over San Francisco looked apocalyptic Wednesday as wildfires burned east of the California city .  The ominous orange ash and smoke floating over the Bay Area actually comes from the Bear Fire burning near Oroville , <extra_id_99> 150 miles northeast of San Francisco . Mike Nicco , a meteorologist at our sister station KGO-TV , explained that a marine layer is protecting the city , so despite scary skies , the local air quality is OK and residents are n't noticing a smoky smell . `` The marine layer is a stable area of air that does not rise , and so we 're continually pumping in cleaner air from over the ocean , '' Nicco said . That 's why the sky is so dark , with a yellow or orange hue .  title: Ominous orange skies loom over San Francisco amid California wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
An eerie orange and brown glow filled the sky above the Bay Area , a mixture of fog and smoke from the fires that cast San Francisco in a perpetual rust colored haze on Wednesday . Citing the `` unprecedented '' and `` historic fire conditions '' in California , 10 national forests were ordered closed on Wednesday , meaning that all 18 national forests in the state will be shut down by 5 p.m. PT on Tuesday . `` These temporary closures are necessary to protect the public and our firefighters , and we will keep them in place until conditions improve and we are confident that National Forest visitors can recreate safely , '' Regional Forester Randy Moore said in a statement .  Wildfires in the state of Washington also continued to burn on Wednesday , with more than <extra_id_99> 576,400 acres charred since a series of blazes were touched off on Labor Day , said state Department of Natural Resources spokesman Joe Smillie . In the small community of Malden , near the Idaho state line , most of the town was destroyed by a fast-moving blaze that swept through the area Monday . Larry Frick , who stayed and fought the fire as it surrounded his home , compared the scene Wednesday to a war zone . `` There were explosions going off non-stop and some really big ones where I could feel it shake the ground , '' he said in an interview .  title: Wildfires rage across West Coast as high temperatures and winds hamper first responders	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
He said the heavy volume of dead trees -- some lying on the ground , some still upright -- is adding enormously to the overall fuel content , making the interior of the fire burn just as intensely as the edge . `` The large amount of dead and downed fuels ... create extreme weather and fire behavior , '' he said . `` The energy produced off that is extraordinary ... large amounts of woody material burning simultaneously . ''  Among other things , the overly-hot interior contributes to the dramatic plumes of smoke shooting <extra_id_99> tens of thousands of feet into the air above the Creek Fire , he said . The plumes are worrisome because they when they collapse , they infuse the fire with massive blasts of air . In addition , unusual nature of the Creek Fire , with extreme temperatures throughout the fire zone and not just on the front edge , means it 's hard to get a handle on where the fire will go next . `` When you have fire that runs 15 miles in one afternoon , there 's no model that can predict that , '' said the Forest Service 's Lohr .  title: ‘Ground zero’ for dead trees.

And , all of this is happening before the traditional start date of the wildfire season .

Fire shelters are occasionally redesigned to better withstand extreme conditions . At 500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 260 degrees Celsius ) , the glue that holds the protective layers together begins to melt . Crew members may have just seconds or minutes to find a safe spot to deploy the shelters , climb inside and manage to hold them tight to the ground despite the whipping gusts that often come with a wall of flames .  The last attempt at a redesign came in 2013 , after <extra_id_99> 19 members of a 20-person hotshot crew from a Prescott , Arizona , fire department died despite using the shelters when a fire overtook them in some hills . Over the next several years , the U.S. Forest Service and other state , federal and local representatives worked with researchers to review hundreds of different materials . Researchers came up with four prototypes that were tested in the field in 2018 , two intended to be used by firefighters who work on the fire lines and two intended for firefighters who operate big equipment . Some performed slightly better than the shelter used now but were ultimately rejected after failing production requirements or because they were heavier and bulkier .  title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives, in some conditions	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
 Associated Press ESTACADA , Ore. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Deadly windblown wildfires raging across the Pacific Northwest destroyed <extra_id_99> hundreds of homes in Oregon , the governor said Wednesday , warning it could be the greatest loss of life and property from wildfire in state history . Firefighters struggled to contain and douse the blazes fanned by 50 mph ( 80 kph ) wind gusts and officials in some western Oregon communities gave residents `` go now '' orders to evacuate , meaning they had minutes to flee their homes . Destructive blazes were burning in a large swath of Washington state and Oregon that rarely experiences such intense fire activity because of the Pacific Northwest 's cool and wet climate . The fires trapped firefighters and civilians behind fire lines in Oregon and leveled an entire small town in eastern Washington .  title: Unprecedented Pacific Northwest fires burn hundreds of homes	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
`` Everyone must be on high alert , '' Brown said . The blazes were thought to be extremely destructive around Medford , in southern Oregon , and near the state capital of Salem . `` This could be the greatest loss of human life and property due to wildfire in our state 's history , '' the governor said .  At least <extra_id_99> two people were reportedly killed in Oregon fires and a small child in blazes in Washington state . Brown said some communities were substantially damaged , with `` hundreds of homes lost . '' The precise extent of damage was unclear because so many of the fire zones were too dangerous to survey , said Oregon Deputy State Fire Marshal Mariana Ruiz-Temple . `` Quite frankly , we are not even able to get into these areas , '' she said .  title: Unprecedented Pacific Northwest fires burn hundreds of homes	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
BOISE , Idaho -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often they are used in wildfires . `` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday . `` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate .

As wildfires of record magnitude swept through Northern California last week , destroying thousands of homes and other structures , the Legislature closed its 2020 session without doing something about the fire insurance crisis that afflicts fire-prone areas . It ranks near the top of a long list of legislative failures this year , right up there with housing shortages and police reforms .  Insurers have sustained massive losses , <extra_id_99> tens of billions of dollars , from wildfires in recent years and are increasingly reluctant to continue coverage in fire-prone communities , even threatening to quit the market if they can not increase premiums enough to cover projected future liabilities . Often , homeowners can only buy coverage through the state 's FAIR plan , which is bare-bones and expensive . The ultimate solution would be to stop building and rebuilding homes in the `` wildland-urban interface '' -- essentially the outer suburbs of major metropolitan areas -- where the risk of catastrophic losses is highest . However , for the foreseeable future , much of California 's population will continue to live in those communities , such as Sonoma and Napa counties , the Sierra foothills and the mountain ranges ringing Los Angeles .  title: Dan Walters: Legislature ignores fire insurance crisis	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Justin Oldfield , executive director of the California Cattle Council , which funded the research , told the Capital Press he hopes the study demonstrates grazing benefits . Some public land agencies already use cattle . Allison Rofe , rangeland specialist for East Bay Parks in California , said she considers cattle grazing of annual grasslands the `` single most effective passive management tool '' in fire control .  The East Bay Regional Park District , she said , leases 70 % of its <extra_id_99> 123,000 acres for grazing . Rofe said the district 's popular lease program has a waiting list . Alan Renz , a cattle rancher with 20 leases , said leasing public land demands more driving time , diesel and employees . But it also provides financial opportunities , forage and security ; if one property burns , he still has 19 others .  title: New study: Cattle grazing significantly reduces wildfire spread	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
A study published this week in Nature Sustainability underscores the scope of the potential impacts from the converging trends . In it , researchers detailed how the health care costs associated with PM 2.5 from the 2019-20 Australian megafires was nearly $ 1.4 billion ( in U.S. dollars ) , with 3,230 hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory disorders and 429 premature deaths attributed to the smoke . Scientist Marshall Burke , associate professor in Stanford University 's Department of Earth System Science , is researching the overall health costs of exposure to six weeks of smoke from the recent wildfires across the West Coast .  Early findings suggest that the smoke impacts are huge , possibly responsible for serious disease or death in <extra_id_99> thousands of people . `` It 's really important in thinking about the overall cost , '' he said , `` putting a sort of a back of the envelope magnitude , on how large these hidden costs could be . '' . Burke said he needs to see more data before he would conclude that a bad fire year will cause more severe illness and more frequent death from Covid-19 .  title: Clouds of Concern Linger as Wildfires Drag into Flu Season and Covid-19 Numbers Swell	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
The blackouts may hit densely populated parts of the San Francisco metropolitan area , including portions of Oakland , Berkeley and Marin County -- cutting power to many residents as they are working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic . San Francisco , at relatively low risk of fires , is the only county in the Bay Area region not expected to be affected . PG&E is n't the only utility warning of outages .  Pacific Power , owned by Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , said Friday that it could switch off power for about <extra_id_99> 5,800 customers in Northern California and Southern Oregon on Sunday due to the gusts , according to a statement . Much of the U.S. West is at risk from wildfires as dry weather and stiff winds turn hillsides , forests and scrub land into tinderboxes . In Colorado , two of the largest fires in state history have forced the closure of Rocky Mountain National Park and triggered the evacuation of nearby towns . And in Utah , Berkshire 's Rocky Mountain Power warned earlier this week it may cut power to about 1,800 customers in Sundance and Summit Park due to fire risk .  title: Californians face biggest power shut-offs this year on fire risk	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
Some of the largest and deadliest fires in recent years were started by utility equipment being damaged by high winds , so PG&E has been aggressive about pre-emptively cutting power when fire conditions are most dangerous . This will be the fifth time PG&E has cut power to customers this year and by far the largest shutdown . `` We obviously recognize that power outages present hardships .  That 's why we try to make it as small as we can , '' PG&E incident commander Mark Quinlan said , noting that the planned shutdown had been reduced from <extra_id_99> 466,000 customers . Cities throughout the region planned to open emergency operations centers and add police officers and firefighters to patrol high-risk areas . Officials also were encouraging people to have their cellphones fully charged or , if they have a landline , to connect an older model phone that does n't depend on electricity . In Berkeley , just east of San Francisco , officials recommended residents consider leaving the hills before Sunday afternoon , especially if they would have trouble getting out quickly during a fire .  title: California girds for most dangerous fire weather of year	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
SAN FRANCISCO -- ( AP ) -- Northern California officials urged residents to leave homes in the hills , secure backyard furniture and other loose items and have an evacuation plan ready ahead of powerful winds that could lead to widespread electricity outages and leave more than 1 million people in the dark . Pacific Gas & Electric said it could black out customers starting Sunday in 38 counties to prevent the chance of sparking wildfires as bone-dry , windy weather returns to the region . In the San Francisco Bay Area , customers in every county except for San Francisco could see their power shut off .  The safety shutoffs were expected to begin as early as Sunday morning and last into Tuesday , affecting <extra_id_99> 466,000 homes and businesses , or more than 1 million residents , assuming between two and three people per home or business customer . The winds that could potentially be the strongest the region has seen in 20 years could topple trees and power lines or other equipment that in recent years have been blamed for igniting massive and deadly blazes in central and Northern California , officials said . East of San Francisco , the city of Berkeley recommended residents consider leaving the hills before Sunday afternoon , especially if they would have trouble getting out quickly during a fire .

While about one-third of the affected customers will be in the Bay Area , cuts are predicted to encompass parts of the Sacramento Valley , the northern and central Sierra Nevada , the Santa Cruz Mountains , the Central Coast and parts of southern Kern County . Some of the largest fires this year have occurred since August but California 's most intense fire weather normally comes in the fall . Eight of the 10 deadliest blazes in state history have occurred in October or November .  In November 2018 , a blaze ignited by PG&E equipment destroyed much of the town of Paradise in Butte County and killed <extra_id_99> 85 people . The projected shutoffs included 19,000 customers in parts of that county . A blaze in the Oakland hills in October 1991 killed 25 people . The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for many areas , predicting winds of 35 mph ( 56 kph ) or higher in San Francisco and lower elevations and up to 70 mph ( 113 kph ) in mountains .  title: 1 million could lose power as California winds whip up	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
The National Weather Service issued red flag warnings for many areas , predicting winds of 35 mph ( 56 kph ) or higher in San Francisco and lower elevations and up to 70 mph ( 113 kph ) in mountains . The concern is that any spark could be blown into flames sweeping through tinder-dry brush and forestland . It said the conditions could equal those during devastating fires in California 's wine country in 2017 and last year 's Kincade Fire .  Fire officials said PG&E transmission lines sparked the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County last October , which destroyed hundreds of homes and caused nearly <extra_id_99> 100,000 people to flee . `` Given that vegetation is now at or near record dryness levels -- much as it was prior to the North Bay firestorm in October 2017 -- this is a very concerning forecast , '' Daniel Swain , climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research , wrote in a blog post . The public safety power shutoff would be the fifth this year , including one that began Wednesday and that ended late Friday . At Silverado Ace Hardware store in Calistoga , people were buying generators , electrical cords , flashlights , batteries , gas cans and other items , said Kathleen Collins , the store 's assistant manager .  title: 1 million could lose power as California winds whip up	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_3>
Scientists say climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable . More 8,600 wildfires have scorched well over 6,400 square miles ( 16,576 square kilometers ) and destroyed about 9,200 buildings in California this year . There have been 31 deaths .  All of the huge fires have been fully or significantly contained , but more than 6,000 firefighters remain committed to <extra_id_99> 19 blazes , including a dozen major incidents , Cal Fire said . Many of this year 's devastating fires were started by thousands of dry lightning strikes . But some of the fires remain under investigation for potential electrical causes . ___ This story has been corrected to show the utility may , not will , cut power to over 1 million people .  title: 1 million could lose power as California winds whip up	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

To address this , Palo Alto 's office of emergency services is working with the startup Perimeter to beta test a product that would act as a kind of Google Maps or Waze for emergency responders . The tool is meant to provide real-time information to first responders during emergencies , allowing them to collaboratively report conditions and download maps to reference offline , as many rural areas where they work have little cell service . It should also improve communication between the various entities responding to fires , including teams from different areas .  Natural disasters do not respect city or county lines -- one fire in the recent spate of wildfires in California straddled the borders of <extra_id_99> three different counties . Currently , communication is coordinated through Computer Aided Dispatch computer systems , which can differ by county and department , and radios , which allow only one person to speak at a time . `` The two-way radio is great for short , quick efficient communication , but then it starts to break down if you need to start giving detailed information or a long list of things , '' Dueker said . `` A picture 's worth a thousand words and I definitely do n't want someone saying a thousand words on radio .

Many moved seasonally , partly to avoid forest fires . As much as one-sixth of the state was deliberately burned each year , simultaneously removing fuel for wildfires and creating new environments for grasses , acorns , deer , and quail . Most obviously , perhaps , people generally did n't live in places like the Santa Cruz Mountains , where food was scarce and fires frequent .  Hardly anyone did , in fact , until the eighteen-seventies , when demand for timber to build new cities made the hillsides profitable ; the rebuilding of San Francisco , after the earthquake in 1906 , turned Boulder Creek into a boomtown , with an impressive <extra_id_99> twenty-six saloons , gambling houses , brothels , and hotels . Almost every redwood tree in the seventy-mile stretch between San Francisco and Santa Cruz was sawed down -- by hand . Once the trees had gone , so , too , of course , did the fire risk and most of the people . Eventually , the mountains started filling up again .  title: How We Escaped the Worst of the California Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
This quiet migration of hundreds of thousands of nature lovers has created one of the most unnatural landscapes on Earth . We have sunk wells everywhere , suppressed fires until the forest floors are thick with fuel , and run high-voltage cables right above them . The 2018 Camp Fire -- which burned two hundred and forty square miles of northern California , caused an estimated $ 16.5 billion in damage , and killed eighty-five people -- was sparked by a Pacific Gas and Electric power line .  According to Cal Fire , the state 's fire-protection agency , one in <extra_id_99> ten Californian houses are in high-risk areas . We knew most of this when we relocated from Chicago , in 1995 , but no one ever suggested that wildfires made the move a bad idea . They were just background noise , like winter rains and earthquakes . Since then , though , one big thing has changed : the fire season is now seventy-five days longer .  title: How We Escaped the Worst of the California Wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Throughout the state , lightning touched the earth nearly eleven thousand times in three days . By the first morning , the fires had begun .

Instead , <extra_id_99> hundreds of separate fires burned , merging together and splitting apart , a many-headed hydra defying standard firefighting tactics . Normal fires are named after their starting point , but this one needed to be called `` the C.Z.U.

Normal fires are named after their starting point , but this one needed to be called `` the C.Z.U. Lightning Complex fires , '' after Cal Fire 's abbreviation for its entire San Mateo-Santa Cruz unit . The world is getting hotter because the atmosphere and oceans contain more carbon dioxide than they used to .  Air bubbles trapped in polar ice show that , during the coldest spells of the last eight hundred thousand years of ice ages , carbon-dioxide levels typically fell in a range of a hundred and eighty to <extra_id_99> two hundred parts per million ; in the warmest interglacial periods , they might rise toward three hundred p.p.m. . But that was before we started burning fossil fuels .

The human condition has improved more in the past hundred years than it did in the previous hundred thousand , and , for all we know , the next hundred will go better still . 2020 does not have to be the new normal . Although only one person was killed in the C.Z.U.  fires , and the flames were stopped some yards from downtown Boulder Creek , nine hundred and <extra_id_99> twenty-five houses did burn , leaving perhaps three thousand people homeless .

A wildfire burning through brush and timber from the mountains to the desert northeast of Los Angeles threatened more than 1,000 homes on Tuesday as crews across the West battled dozens of other major blazes . The Bobcat Fire in Southern California was advancing at one to two miles per hour at times and threatened the Mojave Desert town of Pearblossom after burning into the Antelope Valley foothill area , across the San Gabriel Mountains from Los Angeles .  The blaze that began Sept. 6 has destroyed or damaged at least 29 homes and other buildings , with the toll rising to perhaps <extra_id_99> 85 when damage assessment teams can complete their work this week , authorities said . Firefighters also battled flareups near Mount Wilson , which overlooks greater Los Angeles and has a historic observatory founded more than a century ago and numerous broadcast antennas that serve Southern California . The fire was fueled by vegetation that had n't burned in decades and pushed by erratic winds over the weekend , although they had died down by Monday , and were expected to remain light through Tuesday . Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger U.S. wildfires to global warming from the burning of coal , oil and gas , especially because climate change has made California much drier .  title: California Wildfire Threatening More Than 1,000 Homes	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_4>
A drier California means plants are more flammable . Near Mount Wilson , firefighters set more than a mile of fires designed to burn out the blaze 's fuel and act as a brake on its advance . `` We 've got a fire here that is bigger than the city of Denver , and it did it in two weeks , '' said Sky Cornell with the Los Angeles County Fire Department .  About <extra_id_99> 1,100 homes and some 4,000 residents remained under evacuation orders and the fire was only 17 percent contained , fire officials said . Evacuation warnings -- meaning residents should be prepared to flee if ordered -- remained in effect for the Los Angeles suburb of Pasadena , home of the Rose Bowl and the annual Rose Parade , and Wrightwood , a mountain community near several San Bernardino County ski resorts . The blaze was one of more than two dozen major wildfires burning across California , including five of the largest in state history .

`` Any fires that start may spread rapidly and become difficult to extinguish . '' The National Weather Service issues red flag warnings after consulting with state officials , according to Andy Nash , a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Norton , Massachusetts . A red flag warning is likely to be posted when forests are dry , humidity is below 30 % , gusts are 25 mph or greater , and there 's been less than a quarter-inch of rainfall in the previous five days , he says .  It might not seem like it to somebody walking past the Dunkin' Donuts Center in downtown Providence , but forests cover 53 % of Rhode Island , or <extra_id_99> 367,000 acres , Arnold says . Rural towns with a combination of residences and woodlands are a special concern for people like Arnold and State Fire Marshal Tim McLaughlin . While park rangers , fire marshals and meteorologists pay close attention to the conditions that can cause wildfires , the average person might not . `` We definitely have a concern with people using fire pits , or fireworks , even ground ones , '' McLaughlin says .  title: Experts say fire risk is critical in parched Rhode Island	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>

UC Berkeley scientist Scott Stephens and other fire experts say that the state should step up prescribed burning and forest cleaning . And it is , pouring substantially more money into the effort .

SAN DIEGO -- As the threat of wildfires has grown to a staggering level in California , so has its network of high-tech cameras watching the backcountry to spot the first outbreak of flames and help firefighters battle them until they are contained . The 610th ALERTWildfire camera was installed in California last month , according to the program office at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California , San Diego . The size of the multi-state system almost doubled in the past four months , primarily in California , where more than 4.1 million acres ( 16,592 square kilometers ) have burned this year .  There are also 41 cameras in Nevada , <extra_id_99> nine in Oregon , six in Idaho and one in Washington . Geoscientist Neal Driscoll , director of the ALERTWildfire program at UCSD , said the system allows first responders to begin fighting fires at their outset . `` These cameras save critical time by allowing rapid confirmation of 911 calls and accurate location of new fires using the ALERTWildfire web-based interface , time that would otherwise be spent sending engines to mountaintops or launching aircraft to confirm fire ignition and location , '' he said in a statement .

May we resolve to bring back indigenous knowledge , build resilient homes for all people , practice climate restoration , feed our community , bring justice to this land and food system , love more , and learn to make this road by walking ❤ #phoenixrising #pieranch A post shared by Pie Ranch + Farmstand ( @pie_ranch ) on Aug 22 , 2020 at 12:42 pm PDT Pie Ranch is just one of the many Bay Area farms that have been impacted by wildfires that have already burned more than 1.1 million acres of land across California as of Monday morning . The largest of these , the LNU Lightning Complex fire , has torn through large stretches of wine country and the North Bay , threatening vineyards and , as the Chron reports , hitting small farms in areas like Vacaville in Solano County particularly hard . Meanwhile , the CZU Lightning Complex fire is what officials are calling the wildfire that has swept through the Santa Cruz mountains , hitting many of the farms and residences on the Central Coast -- that 's the fire that swept through the Pescadero area over the weekend .  Pie Ranch , which is named after the triangular shape of the <extra_id_99> 14-acre property , was founded in 2004 and probably best known for its educational programs -- partnerships with San Francisco 's Mission High and other local schools , helping students understand the complexities of the food system and giving them the opportunity to have first-hand experience on a working farm . Its farmstand , which sold -- yes -- pies as well as strawberries and other produce in season , was a popular stop for sightseers traveling along the coast on Highway 1 . I 'm bereft to hear that Pescadero 's Pie Ranch has burned down . It 's a regular stop driving along the coast to pick up pie and fresh produce .  title: Wildfires Destroy the 157-Year-Old Farmhouse at Pie Ranch	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_2>
Having burned 363,772 acres at 10 percent containment , the SCU Fire has taken the mantle of second largest wildfire in California history . Meanwhile , firefighters battling the CZU fires had started to make some significant headway in suppressing the fires in the Santa Cruz mountains Monday , upping the containment to 17 percent . However , the fire had destroyed 330 buildings -- twice the amount from yesterday .  As <extra_id_99> 289 new lightning strikes kept firefighters on edge Sunday night , crews continued to battle the lightning complex fires and hundreds of other blazes burning over 1 million acres Monday . More than 100,000 people have been displaced from their homes , and seven have died in the catastrophic blazes , which have overwhelmed firefighters in California .

A climate of extremes here in recent years -- wet winters and springs followed suddenly by hot , dry summers -- has virtually erased the time frame for what had for decades constituted fire season . In his briefing , Newsom said the state had experienced 4,292 fires , which burned a total of 56,000 acres , by this time last year . This year the total acreage charred so far here is 1.4 million acres .  There have been <extra_id_99> 7,002 fires , a 63 percent increase from the previous year . Though more than 14,000 firefighters are confronting the flames , the sheer number of outbreaks and sweeping , ember-carrying winds have left crews playing catch-up for days . Seven states have sent fire engines to California despite their own worries that dry , hot and windy conditions at home will spark similar blazes . AD California also is somewhat shorthanded because crews of prison inmates , numbering 28 each , usually help fight such fires by clearing brush ahead of the flames to create breaks and carrying out other essential tasks .  title: California wildfires have charred 1.2 million acres, with more than 100,000 evacuees	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>

The work , while sometimes hazardous , is voluntary , pays nominally , and goes toward a prisoner 's credit for early release . As Monday began , fire officials appeared most worried about the shifting winds , which in the northern LNU fire threatened to push flames toward the Sonoma County towns of Healdsburg and Guerneville , both popular wine-country tourist destinations . That fire is now nearly a quarter contained .  The same was true of the smaller CZU Lightning Complex fire that is the southwestern-most of <extra_id_99> three major Bay Area fires , having burned more than 50,000 acres in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties , including historic coastal Redwood groves . Newsom said such `` dense forests ... are historically immune from significant fires along our coast . '' `` This is a region that has simply never seen forest fires because of the weather conditions , '' said Newsom , who spent part of the weekend visiting that area . `` It is a proof point that we are in a different climate and we are dealing with different climate conditions that are precipitating fires the likes of which we have n't seen in modern recorded history .

BOISE -- Almost 1.4 million acres of California are burning as wildfire season peaks across the parched West . The National Interagency Fire Center in an Aug. 24 briefing reported 93 large fires have burned more than 1.8 million acres -- nearly 1.4 million acres in California alone .  More than <extra_id_99> 26,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to fires across the country , the Boise-based NIFC said . Evacuation orders were in effect near 20 large fires in California , Arizona , Colorado , Oregon and Utah .

However , some species and ecosystems are threatened when fire does n't occur . Frequent fires , for example , are an important part of African savanna ecosystems and less fire activity can lead to shrub encroachment , which can displace wild herbivores such as wildebeest that prefer open areas . `` Understanding what 's causing changes in different places helps us to find effective solutions that benefit people and nature , '' Kelly said .  Researchers , including <extra_id_99> 27 authors from a combined 25 institutions around the world , identified three main groups of human drivers as transforming fire activity and its impacts on biodiversity : global climate change , land-use and biotic invasions . This means that people and governments around the world need to act and confront the diverse changes to the environment that are occurring . `` It really is time for new , bolder conservation initiatives , '' Kelly said . `` Emerging actions include large-scale habitat restoration , reintroductions of mammals that reduce fuels , creation of low-flammability green spaces and letting bushfires burn under the right conditions .  title: At Least 4,400 Species are Globally Facing Threats Due to Changes in Wildfire Intensity, Finds Study	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
We see that in the lab and we see that in the field . '' But in other Western states , adopting similar codes has hit roadblocks .

The decision fell to Oregon 's Residential and Manufactured Structures Board , a <extra_id_99> 11-member committee that reviews state building codes . With temperatures warming due to climate change , Oregon 's normally damp forests and woodlands have been drier during the summer , priming them for more extreme fires . Fire officials like Ralph Sartain of Ashland Fire and Rescue thought it was only a matter of time before Oregon saw the destructive fires that had already plagued California . `` We 're pushing further and further into the mountains but we 're not doing anything to protect the buildings , '' Sartain testified at the board 's hearing .  title: Rebuilding After A Wildfire?

A study by Headwaters Economics found fire-resistant homes can be cheaper than traditional homes , thanks in large part to using more affordable fiber-cement siding . Home builders also questioned the codes because they would only apply to new houses , not existing homes , which could still leave neighborhoods vulnerable .

3 . The warming climate A warming climate exacerbates wildfire by extracting moisture -- nature 's flame retardant -- from the plant materials that burn . Higher temperatures increase the pace of transpiration -- the process by which a plant takes moisture in through the roots and loses it through leaves and needles .  All other things being equal , an increase in temperature of 10 degrees Centigrade -LRB- from 68F to 86F -RRB- can result in a factor of 3 increase in the rate of water loss by transpiration in plants .1 A 20 % reduction in moisture content increases the probability of fire spread under modest winds by a factor of <extra_id_99> four for California shrubs -LRB- again , all things being equal , like wind speed , fuel loading and slope -RRB- .2 Given the dynamics of heat and moisture , it makes sense that wildfires are worse than ever when temperatures are at their highest . Southern California has seen a threefold increase in heatwave frequency over the past two decades . Los Angeles County recorded its highest temperature ever on September 6 at 121 F. Death Valley just hit 130 F , perhaps the highest temperature ever recorded on the planet . The overall process of denser , drier plant material helps explain why some recent fires , such as the Camp Fire of 2018 , are burning more intensely and spreading at speeds significantly faster than the wind speed due to the rate at which radiant heat , local flow acceleration , and a storm of burning embers get lofted ahead of the main flames .  title: Three Reasons America’s Wildfire Costs Will Continue To Get Worse	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

DENVER ( Reuters ) - Crews battling a string of wildfires in drought-stricken Colorado braced on Friday for the return of high winds that have stoked flames in what authorities have called an unprecedented outbreak of late-season wildfires . Three of the largest wildfires in Colorado 's history have raged this year and two of them are still growing . The largest , the Cameron Peak Fire , has scorched more than 206,000 acres ( 83,360 hectares ) , according to the fire-reporting site InciWeb , and as of Friday morning it was 57 percent contained .  Eleven miles to the south , the second biggest blaze on record , the East Troublesome Fire , has charred a total of 170,000 acres -LRB- 68,797 hectares -RRB- , and crews have carved containment lines around just <extra_id_99> 5 % of the perimeter . Cooler weather and calmer winds overnight slowed the growth of the Troublesome fire , but winds are expected to pick up in the afternoon , incident commander Noel Livingston said at a Friday morning briefing Flames jumped the Continental Divide on Thursday , forcing the closure of the 415-square-mile ( 1,075-square-km ) Rocky Mountain National Park . The fire prompted Grand County officials to order the evacuations of several mountain towns . Sheriff Brett Schroetlin could not confirm any fatalities .  title: Crews battling largest wildfires in Colorado history brace for high winds	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
That can get fixed by shopping malls taking more responsibility , or that can get fixed ... by us going ahead and looking at whether we need to change [ health ] orders , '' Ferrer said . `` But I think the right place to start is to go and take a hard look at what 's going on . '' Shopping malls have come under fire from the L.A. County public health department recently .  County investigators issue fines of up to $ <extra_id_99> 500 for serious violations of COVID-19 precautions . At malls , these would include not prohibiting eating and drinking , not facilitating social distancing in common spaces and not keeping occupancy below 20 % of capacity , among other safety measures.The Glendale Galleria was cited last week .

Proposition 19 allows homeowners who are over 55 , disabled , or wildfire/disaster victims to transfer primary residence 's tax base to a replacement residence . It changes the taxation of family-property transfers and establishes a fire protection services fund .  Local governments could gain <extra_id_99> tens of millions of dollars of property tax revenue per year , probably growing over time to a few hundred million dollars per year . Schools could receive similar property tax gains . A yes vote means all homeowners who are over 55 ( or who meet other qualifications ) would be eligible for property tax savings when they move . Only inherited properties used as primary homes or farms would be eligible for property tax savings .  title: Proposition 19: Changes Certain Property Tax Rules	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>
Not only are we right in the peak of the wildfire season ... many of us are working from home , schooling from home as well , '' he said . `` We recognize that hardships are introduced when we shut off power . '' Barbara Nemko , Napa County 's superintendent of schools , said the warnings of high winds and intense heat sent `` a shiver down my spine . ''  `` After undergoing <extra_id_99> two major fires in the last two months it 's almost unthinkable that we are having to prepare yet again for the possibility , '' Nemko said . She said the district has been fortunate that no public schools burned this year . Still , the costs have piled up as schools had to throw out large quantities of spoiled food , buy pricey filters to address terrible air quality and ash in the air , and secure generators to deal with outages . Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal , oil and gas .  title: Power cut to thousands in Cal­i­fornia to prevent wildfires	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_1>
PG&E 's aging equipment has sparked several major fires in recent years , including a 2018 blaze that killed 85 people and destroyed much of the town of Paradise . The community was among those affected by the outages Wednesday , which led school officials to suspended all virtual classes . The utility pleaded guilty in June to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter -- one death was ruled a suicide -- and paid $ 25.5 billion in settlements to cover losses from that and other recent power line-sparked catastrophes .  ___ This story has been corrected to show massive power outages happened in 2019 , not 2018 , and affected <extra_id_99> 2 million people , not 5 million . ___ Associated Press writer Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco also contributed to this story .

SACRAMENTO -- President Donald Trump 's administration rejected California 's request for a major disaster declaration tied to the Creek Fire and five other catastrophic blazes that started last month . Impact : The rejection came the same day that Trump authorized the federal government to take on all of the state 's costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for a separate set of wildfires from August , prompting questions as to why the White House appeared to be selective with its assistance to the Golden State . Background : California this year has experienced the worst fire season in its recorded history , with over 4.1 million acres burned , 31 deaths and 9,200-plus structures damaged or destroyed so far .  Many blazes were sparked in August , two months earlier than the usual peak of fire season , and Trump on Wednesday increased the federal cost share for those blazes from the typical 75 percent to <extra_id_99> 100 percent . Those lightning-ignited fire complexes in the Bay Area became the third - and fourth-largest blazes in state history .

With EMT licenses and felony expungements secured , former inmate firefighters can finally satisfy most fire departments ' initial screening requirements . But unfortunately , expungement alone does not guarantee job offers -- even for the most qualified candidates . For many , their journey came to an abrupt halt during the job interview .  These <extra_id_99> two issues plague the otherwise well-written AB2147 . First , expungement does not erase an applicant 's incarceration record , which is often both the source of their firefighting experience and the basis of the discrimination they face . Thus , ex-felons can not discuss their previous firefighting experience on their applications without exposing themselves to prejudice . The second problem has to do with the unique needs of incarcerated immigrants .  title: From Jailhouse to Firehouse: California’s AB2147 Pros And Cons for Inmate Firefighters	answer: <extra_id_99> <extra_id_6>

Hennepin County prosecutors charged Bogdan Vechirko , of Otsego , with making threats of violence , a felony , and criminal vehicular operation , a gross misdemeanor , the Star Tribune reported . Prosecutors allege that he sought to `` scare '' protesters out of his path and could have seen them with plenty of time to stop before his truck reached them . Vechirko , 35 , drove onto the Interstate 35W bridge over the Mississippi River as thousands of people protested the death of Floyd , who died six days earlier in the custody of Minneapolis police .  Nobody was seriously hurt , though criminal complaint says at least <extra_id_99> one protester suffered abrasions as she jumped to get out of the truck 's path . Vechirko told investigators he was returning from a fuel delivery in Minneapolis and did n't mean to drive into the protest or hurt anyone . Authorities had closed area highways as a precaution , but traffic camera video showed that the trucker entered the downtown freeway system from a ramp that was n't barricaded , for reasons that remain unclear . When Vechirko saw the crowd on the bridge , he `` relied on his professional instinct and training to avoid a hard brake that could have jackknifed the truck and could have seriously injured or killed thousands of people , and instead slowed his vehicle while maneuvering through the parted crowd , '' his attorney Mark Solheim , told the newspaper . title: Trucker who drove through George Floyd protesters is charged	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> Minnesota Minneapolis </s>

'' Based on social media video , an individual in the crowd appears to have pointed a handgun at Vechirko and to have discharged two rounds into the tractor 's front tire , Solheim said .

Marchers and protesters have honored Floyd , as well Breonna Taylor , a Black woman who was shot and killed by Louisville police after they entered her home while she was sleeping .

Allegheny County Councilors , even Democrats , are still largely backing police priorities over the demands of advocates . Nine Democrats joined three Republicans to reject a county bill that would have banned police from using `` less lethal '' weapons like tear gas and sponge rounds . The bill failed by a 12-3 vote .  Allegheny County Councilor Nick Futules -LRB- D-Oakmont -RRB- spoke in opposition to the bill in July , and he said police officers needed the `` less lethal '' weapons and accused protesters of participating in an `` onslaught '' in East Liberty , in reference to the events of June 1 that resulted in all <extra_id_99> 22 arrested protesters having their charges dropped and the city being sued by at least six protesters for the police 's actions .

 The Holy Name rotary in West Roxbury played host to dueling protests Wednesday evening as <extra_id_99> hundreds showed up to chant `` Black Lives Matter '' -- and even more came to say `` Back the Blue . '' Simultaneous rallies -- the `` Stand for the Blue '' gathering in support of police and the `` Black Lives Matter Vigil for all victims of police brutality '' both started shortly after 5 p.m. Wednesday , and , for the most part , the two rapidly swelling groups stayed slightly separated by a neutral zone where several police officers kept watch . Protests have continued for the past three weeks following several high-profile police killings of black people , and activists push for more oversight over police , changes in use-of-force rules and , most recently , defunding departments -- though the amount of funds demonstrators say should be cut and moved to social services varies . Several people at the Blue Lives Matter rally said they support most of the causes protesters are calling for -- just not the heat of their rhetoric . title: Dueling Black Lives Matter, pro-police rallies take place in Boston	answer: <extra_id_10> <extra_id_8> Massachusetts Boston </s>

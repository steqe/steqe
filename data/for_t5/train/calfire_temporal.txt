LOS ANGELES - Five weeks after California erupted in deadly wildfires supercharged by record heat and howling winds , crews battling flames pushed Monday to consolidate their gains before the return of the blistering , gusty weather . California has lost far more landscape to wildfires this summer than during any previous entire year , with scores of conflagrations , many sparked by catastrophic lightning storms , scorching about 3.4 million acres since mid-August . The previous record was just less than 2 million acres burned in 2018 .  As of Monday , more than <extra_id_99> 19,000 firefighters continued to wage war on 27 major blazes across the state , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection -LRB- CalFire -RRB- . The fires , stoked by extreme weather conditions that scientists have pointed to as signs of climate change , have destroyed an estimated 6,100 homes and other structures and killed 26 people , three of them firefighters , CalFire reported . Another 2 million acres have gone up in flames in Oregon and Washington state during an overlapping outbreak of wildfires that started earlier this month , destroying more than 4,400 structures in all and claiming 10 lives . But a weekend of intermittently heavy showers across the western Cascade mountain range helped fire crews in the Pacific Northwest tamp down blazes in those two states .  title: California Firefighters Race to Subdue Flames Before Heat, Winds Return dct: Monday, Sep 21 2020, 19:11:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-09-21 </s>	Resources

As crews battled wildfires that have killed at least 35 people , destroyed neighborhoods and enveloped the West Coast in smoke , Trump contended that the states are to blame for failing to rake leaves and clear dead timber from forest floors . However , many of the California blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands , not forest , and some of the largest are burning on federal land . In Oregon , it was the forests that burned at unprecedented levels this past week .  Almost the same number of `` megafires '' -- defined as having scorched <extra_id_99> 100,000 acres or more -- were burning last week as have occurred during the entire last century , said Jim Gersbach , spokesman for the Oregon Department of Forestry . Experts , environmentalists and loggers largely agree that thinning trees and brush through prescribed burns and careful logging will help prevent forests that cover vast tracts of the American West from threatening cities with fire . But whether that would have spared towns is less clear .

Wildfire smoke continues to make air quality poor across wide swaths of Northern California , including the Sacramento region . There 's no relief in sight the next few days , weather officials say . The air is unhealthy and the sun has been slow to peek through Thursday near the capital , but it is indeed smoke , not clouds , turning the sky gray .

Only two other years since 2002 have seen more acreage scorched , and the 2020 fire season , of course , is still going .

The latest threats came amid what meteorologists called the strongest onslaught of extreme winds - and lowest humidity levels - yet documented during an already epic California wildfire season ranked as the worst on record in terms of acreage burned . Fires have scorched more than 6,400 square miles ( 16,500 square kilometres ) - equivalent to the land mass of the state of Hawaii - since the start of the year , with thousands of homes destroyed and 31 lives lost . Red flag warnings for incendiary weather conditions remained in place across much of California due to winds gusting in excess of 80 miles per hour ( 129 kph ) , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .  Illustrating the hazards posed by California 's latest bout of desert-born winds , a blaze dubbed the Silverado fire erupted early Monday and spread across <extra_id_99> 7,200 acres -LRB- 2,913 hectares -RRB- of Orange County by late afternoon , county fire authority spokesman Thanh Nguyen told Reuters . Utility company Southern California Edison said its equipment is under investigation as a possible source of the blaze . Some 90,800 residents were ordered evacuated from homes in and around the city of Irvine as the fire raged largely unchecked through drought-parched brush in the canyons and foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains south of Los Angeles , officials said . No property losses were immediately reported .  title: Wind-whipped Southern California wildfires prompt mass evacuations, injure two firefighters dct: Monday, Oct 26 2020, 17:12:45	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-10-26 </s>	Physical measurements
A second Orange County blaze , the Blueridge fire , later broke out near Yorba Linda and has charred roughly 1,200 acres ( 485 hectares ) , Nguyen said .

PRECAUTIONARY OUTAGES Southern California Edison reported shutting off electricity to <extra_id_99> 21,000 homes and businesses as a precautionary measure in the face of elevated fire risks posed by dangerous winds . Hundreds of miles away , the Pacific Gas and Electric Company ( PG&E ) said it had cut off power to more than 350,000 of its customers for the same reason . Wind-damaged electrical lines have been implicated in causing dozens of devastating California wildfires in recent years , and utilities have increasingly resorted to such `` public safety power shutoffs '' to reduce the risk .

1 of 3 BOISE , Idaho -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often crews are forced to use them during wildfires . `` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday . `` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate . ''  Still , the shelters have saved more than <extra_id_99> 300 firefighters since they began being used in the 1960s and became required in firefighting equipment in the late 1970s , Bilbao said . They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees of heat for about a minute . The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure . The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said .  title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives but raise questions dct: Sunday, Sep 13 2020, 13:00:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown unknown </s>	People impacted (positively/negatively)

Debris flows are fast-moving slurries of soil , rock , water , and vegetation that are especially perilous because they usually occur without any warning . Some debris flows are powerful enough to cart off everything in their paths , including trees , boulders , vehicles -- and even homes .  Two years ago in Montecito , California , <extra_id_99> 23 people were killed and more than 400 homes damaged by a series of debris flows spawned by intense rain falling on hills scorched by what at the time had been the largest fire in California history . To better understand the origin of these hazards , researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) studied slope failure at two sites in Southern California 's San Gabriel Mountains . The first site burned in 2016 during the San Gabriel Complex fire , whereas a second , nearby site was charred during the 2014 Colby fire . The findings , presented Wednesday during the annual meeting of The Geological Society of America , indicate there were major differences in slope failure between the first and the third years following incineration .  title: Post-wildfire hazards: Toward an understanding of when & how slope failure may occur dct: Tuesday, Oct 27 2020, 00:00:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-10-27 </s>	People impacted (positively/negatively)

Even in areas that are untouched by the fires themselves , the rippling effects of these fires can and have been felt far and wide . California 's wildfire season has caused increased pollutants that raise the Air Quality Index in past years , such as the Kincaide fire of 2019 , which caused AQI levels of 150 or more . However , the combination of fires this year , both in state and out of state , have sparked unprecedented highs .

LOS ANGELES ( AP ) - Investigations found that damaged electrical equipment ignited two Southern California wildfires last year , including one that threatened the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum , a fire agency said Thursday . The investigative results for two fires that broke out northwest of Los Angeles a year ago were released as power cuts were underway in parts of Northern California to prevent electrical equipment from igniting fires amid gusty , dry weather .  The <extra_id_99> 1,800-acre Easy Fire , which threatened the library and nearby Simi Valley homes , ignited Oct. 30 , 2019 , when an insulator attached to a Southern California Edison high-voltage transmission line swung into a steel power pole during windy , dry conditions , the Ventura County Fire Department said in a statement . At the time , the utility reported to state regulators that its equipment may have been involved in the fire , which damaged two buildings . The Ventura County department also said the Maria Fire near Santa Paula was ignited the next day by failure of a conductor on an electrical distribution line owned by California Resources Corp. `` Fire investigators found that an electrical conductor separated and contacted a metal pipe on the ground , igniting the fire , '' the department said . Nearly 15.6 square miles were scorched , and four buildings were damaged .  title: 2 Southern California wildfires last year blamed on electrical lines dct: Thursday, Oct 22 2020, 17:16:48	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown unknown </s>	Physical measurements

The efficacy of the network to confirm and monitor wildfires was readily apparent and interagency investment created a surge in camera numbers as they quickly became an essential tool .

Pollution from power plants and vehicles , pesticides , fertilizers and chemicals in waste can all make their way into trees and plants .

University of Colorado-Boulder professor Jennifer Balch said measurements of how quickly the hot , dry air is sucking moisture out of fuels are `` the highest seen in at least four decades '' across major parts of the West . The abundant dry tinder produces more heat energy , which in turn super-heats the air so it becomes more buoyant and creates a strong updraft that condenses with the smoke plume , `` creating its own wind to feed that thunderstorm , '' Flannigan said . The cloud itself is called a pyro-cumulonimbus , which may or may not produce lightning , and strong winds that can pick up burning embers and ignite new fires far in front of the initial blaze .  An extreme example in July 2018 spun off what was then only the second documented `` firenado , '' killing <extra_id_99> a firefighter as he helped evacuate residents from a fire in the Northern California city of Redding .

Numerous studies in recent years have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal , oil and gas . Scientists say climate change has made California much drier , meaning trees and other plants are more flammable . The latest fires erupted as a giant ridge of high pressure settled over the West , producing powerful gusts blowing from the interior toward the coast while slashing humidity levels and raising temperatures .  So far in this year 's historic fire season , more than 8,100 California wildfires have now killed <extra_id_99> 29 people , scorched 5,780 square miles -LRB- 14,970 square kilometers -RRB- , and destroyed more than 7,000 buildings .

The following year , the Camp Fire surpassed the 2017 fire event to become the most costly fire on record : 85 civilian deaths and $ 16.5 billion in damages . While the genesis of the Camp Fire was a faulty PG&E electric transmission line , the utility fought the assignment of blame for the 2017 fires ; after all , PG&E was still on probation for its role in the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion . That incident occurred after a 30-inch natural gas mainline exploded , resulting in the destruction of 38 homes , eight deaths and a $ 565 million settlement for victims .  Ultimately , of the <extra_id_99> 12 fires that combined to create the 2017 Northern California firestorm , PG&E was found responsible for causing all but one of those fires . October of 2019 brought red-flag conditions to the San Francisco Bay Area , resulting in PG&E 's institution of the PSPS . While areas in the North Bay experienced high winds and hot temperatures , the South Bay did not ; however , the intricacy of PG&E 's transmission lines meant that even areas with 2-3 mph winds were at the mercy of the utility 's actions , resulting in 30 counties and over 3 million people losing power during the month . Following that PSPS , the utility 's CEO stated that it had found over 100 cases of wind-related damage to nearly 25,000 miles of power lines in the state , and announced that by taking preemptive action , PG&E had averted potential fires within the grid .  title: PG&E’s PSPS Leaves SLV in the Dark dct: Friday, Oct 30 2020, 03:00:00	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown unknown </s>	Number of fires

Citing the `` unprecedented '' and `` historic fire conditions '' in California , 10 national forests were ordered closed on Wednesday , meaning that all 18 national forests in the state will be shut down by 5 p.m. PT on Tuesday . `` These temporary closures are necessary to protect the public and our firefighters , and we will keep them in place until conditions improve and we are confident that National Forest visitors can recreate safely , '' Regional Forester Randy Moore said in a statement .

He said the heavy volume of dead trees -- some lying on the ground , some still upright -- is adding enormously to the overall fuel content , making the interior of the fire burn just as intensely as the edge . `` The large amount of dead and downed fuels ... create extreme weather and fire behavior , '' he said . `` The energy produced off that is extraordinary ... large amounts of woody material burning simultaneously . ''  Among other things , the overly-hot interior contributes to the dramatic plumes of smoke shooting <extra_id_99> tens of thousands of feet into the air above the Creek Fire , he said . The plumes are worrisome because they when they collapse , they infuse the fire with massive blasts of air . In addition , unusual nature of the Creek Fire , with extreme temperatures throughout the fire zone and not just on the front edge , means it 's hard to get a handle on where the fire will go next . `` When you have fire that runs 15 miles in one afternoon , there 's no model that can predict that , '' said the Forest Service 's Lohr .  title: ‘Ground zero’ for dead trees.

Fire shelters are occasionally redesigned to better withstand extreme conditions . At 500 degrees Fahrenheit ( 260 degrees Celsius ) , the glue that holds the protective layers together begins to melt . Crew members may have just seconds or minutes to find a safe spot to deploy the shelters , climb inside and manage to hold them tight to the ground despite the whipping gusts that often come with a wall of flames .  The last attempt at a redesign came in 2013 , after <extra_id_99> 19 members of a 20-person hotshot crew from a Prescott , Arizona , fire department died despite using the shelters when a fire overtook them in some hills . Over the next several years , the U.S. Forest Service and other state , federal and local representatives worked with researchers to review hundreds of different materials . Researchers came up with four prototypes that were tested in the field in 2018 , two intended to be used by firefighters who work on the fire lines and two intended for firefighters who operate big equipment . Some performed slightly better than the shelter used now but were ultimately rejected after failing production requirements or because they were heavier and bulkier .  title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives, in some conditions dct: Wednesday, Sep 09 2020, 18:05:33	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2013-12-31 </s>	People impacted (positively/negatively)
 Associated Press ESTACADA , Ore. -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Deadly windblown wildfires raging across the Pacific Northwest destroyed <extra_id_99> hundreds of homes in Oregon , the governor said Wednesday , warning it could be the greatest loss of life and property from wildfire in state history . Firefighters struggled to contain and douse the blazes fanned by 50 mph ( 80 kph ) wind gusts and officials in some western Oregon communities gave residents `` go now '' orders to evacuate , meaning they had minutes to flee their homes . Destructive blazes were burning in a large swath of Washington state and Oregon that rarely experiences such intense fire activity because of the Pacific Northwest 's cool and wet climate .

1 of 4 BOISE , Idaho ( AP ) -- After flames trapped 14 firefighters in California and they had to use last-resort fire shelters to survive , questions are emerging about how well the emergency devices work and how often crews are forced to use them during wildfires . `` They are for an extreme emergency , never to be considered as an alternative to safe firefighting , '' National Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Carrie Bilbao said Wednesday . `` They 're to be used as a last resort if there 's no planned escape out or safety zones become inadequate . ''  Still , the shelters have saved more than <extra_id_99> 300 firefighters since they began being used in the 1960s and became required in firefighting equipment in the late 1970s , Bilbao said . They look like oversized silver sleeping bags , weigh about 4.5 pounds ( 2 kilograms ) and are made of an aluminum foil-woven silica outer shell designed to withstand direct flames and 2,000 degrees ( 1,090 Celsius ) of heat for about a minute . The shelters do n't stand up well to direct flames or longer periods of heat exposure . The U.S. Forest Service and other agencies spent years trying to create a better fire shelter , but all the prototypes were rejected last year after officials decided the current shelter provided `` the most practical amount of protection given trade-offs of weight , volume ( bulk ) , durability and material toxicity , '' the National Wildfire Coordinating Group said .  title: Emergency fire shelters can save lives but raise questions dct: Wednesday, Sep 09 2020, 19:42:46	answer: <extra_id_99> unknown 2020-09-09 </s>	People impacted (positively/negatively)

For starters , it 's based on state-specific data , whereas the Washington model primarily relies on data from Wuhan , China , where the first epidemic occurred , and also Italy and Spain , where COVID-19 also quickly reached epidemic levels , before arriving in the U.S. , erupting in a major outbreak in a Washington state nursing home owned by a Cleveland , Tennessee , nursing home chain . Noting China , Italy and Spain eventually cracked down with far more stringent actions than Tennessee has taken , Graves said the Vanderbilt model is fueled by Tennessee 's experiences and actions , which he said fall short of those three countries ' actions . Graves said the model relies on the shown rate of infection where aggressive measures to contain COVID-19 have n't been implemented .  Each infected person passes the virus on to <extra_id_99> five other people , who in turn do the same to others and so on down the chain . The professor said that in order to `` suppress '' the pandemic that spans much of the globe , a transmission number less than 1.0 `` must be sustained . '' In his presentation , Graves said many models assume a one-time change in the transmission number as a result of policy and/or behavioral changes . Because Vanderbilt 's model traces out the effective transmission number over time , the data evaluate the relative success of policy changes to date and predict hypothetical changes to the transmission number in the future . title: One Vanderbilt University COVID-19 model shows best-case Tennessee scenario is up to 3,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations	answer: <extra_id_4> </s> </s> </s> </s>
